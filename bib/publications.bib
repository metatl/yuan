	abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

Though closely related to semantic segmentation, medical image segmentation includes specific challenges that need to be addressed, such as the scarcity of labelled data, the high class imbalance found in the ground truth and the high memory demand of three-dimensional images. In this work, a CNN-based method with three-dimensional filters is demonstrated and applied to hand and brain MRI. Two modifications to an existing CNN architecture are discussed, along with methods on addressing the aforementioned challenges.

In contrast, we investigate the effectiveness of a single neural network for end-to-end long-term prediction of mechanical phenomena. Based on extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that such networks can outperform alternate approaches having even access to ground-truth physical simulators, especially when some physical parameters are unobserved or not known a-priori. Further, our network outputs a distribution of outcomes to capture the inherent uncertainty in the data. Our approach demonstrates for the first time the possibility of making actionable long-term predictions from sensor data without requiring to explicitly model the underlying physical laws.},

This was done by comparing surface aerosol measurements with convective cloud microphysical profiles produced from satellite image analyses.The results show that the clouds associated with the anthropogenic-affected air with high PM0.5, had to acquire a vertical development of similar to 3.5 km before forming precipitation-sized particles, compared to less than 1 km for the clouds associated with low PM0.5 air-masses.Additionally, a comparison of profiles with precipitation was done with regard to different potentially important parameters. For precipitating clouds the variability of the cloud thickness needed to produce the precipitation (Delta h(14)) is directly related to PM0.5 concentrations, even without considering atmospheric stability, the specific aerosol size distribution or the aerosols' chemical composition. Each additional 1 mu g m(-3) of PM0.5 was found to increase Delta h(14) by similar to 200-250 m.Our conclusion is that it is indeed possible to detect the effects of anthropogenic aerosol on the convective clouds in southern Scandinavia despite modest aerosol masses. It also emphasizes the importance of including aerosol processes in climate-radiation models and in numerical weather prediction models.},

	abstract = {The feasibility of hurricane modification was investigated for hurricane Katrina using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). The possible impact of seeding of clouds with submicron cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) on hurricane structure and intensity as measured by nearly halving of the area covered by hurricane force winds was simulated by 'turning-off' warm rain formation in the clouds at Katrina's periphery (where wind speeds were less than 22 m s(-1)). This simplification of the simulation of aerosol effects is aimed at evaluating the largest possible response. This resulted in the weakening of the hurricane urface winds compared to the 'non-seeded' simulated storm during the first 24 h within the entire tropical cyclone (TC) area compared to a control simulation without warm rain suppression. Later, the seeding-induced evaporative cooling at the TC periphery led to a shrinking of the eye and hence to some increase in the wind within the small central area of the TC. Yet, the overall strength of the hurricane, as defined by the area covered by hurricane force winds, decreased in response to the suppressed warm rain at the periphery, as measured by a 25\% reduction in the radius of hurricane force winds. In a simulation with warm rain suppression throughout the hurricane, the radius of the hurricane force winds was reduced by more than 42\%, and although the diameter of the eye shrunk even further the maximum winds weakened. This shows that the main mechanism by which suppressing warm rain weakens the TC is the low level evaporative cooling of the un-precipitated cloud drops and the added cooling due to melting of precipitation that falls from above.},

It is found that the positive-buoyancy contribution to CAPE resulting from the latent heat of fusion more than offsets the negative-buoyancy contribution due to water loading in the reversible thermodynamic process. The departure from moist neutrality in much of the tropical atmosphere exhibits a threshold in boundary-layer wet-bulb potential temperature of 22-degrees-23-degrees-C. The corresponding sea surface temperature is approximately 26-degrees-C, close to the empirical threshold for hurricane formation, which suggests that conditional instability plays an important role in the latter phenomenon. The simultaneous presence of finite CAPE and infrequent deep convection in the tropics is tentatively attributed to the convective inhibition energy (CINE) and to the mixing process that destroys positive buoyancy in incipient cloud parcels.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric water vapour is a key element of the Earth's climate, which has direct effects as a greenhouse gas, as well as indirect effects through interaction with clouds, aerosols and tropospheric chemistry. Small changes in upper-tropospheric water vapour have a much larger impact on the greenhouse effect than small changes in water vapour in the lower atmosphere(1), but whether this impact is a positive or negative feedback remains uncertain(2-6). The main challenge in addressing this question is the difficulty in monitoring upper-tropospheric water vapour globally over long timescales. Here I show that upper-tropospheric water-vapour variability and global lightning activity are closely linked, suggesting that upper-tropospheric water-vapour changes can be inferred from records of global lightning activity, readily obtained from observations at a single location on the Earth's surface. This correlation reflects the fact that continental deep-convective thunderstorms transport large amounts of water vapour into the upper troposphere and thereby dominate the variations of global upper-tropospheric water vapour while producing most of the lightning on Earth. As global lightning induces Schumann resonances, an electromagnetic phenomenon in the atmosphere that can be observed easily at low cost, monitoring of these resonances might provide a convenient method for tracking upper-tropospheric water-vapour variability and hence contribute to a better understanding of the processes affecting climate change.},

	abstract = {During the TROCCINOX field experiments in February - March 2004 and February 2005, airborne in situ measurements of NO, NOy, CO, and O-3 mixing ratios and the J(NO2) photolysis rate were carried out in the anvil outflow of thunderstorms over southern Brazil. Both tropical and subtropical thunderstorms were investigated, depending on the location of the South Atlantic convergence zone. Tropical air masses were discriminated from subtropical ones according to the higher equivalent potential temperature ( 2 e) in the lower and mid troposphere, the higher CO mixing ratio in the mid troposphere, and the lower wind velocity in the upper troposphere within the Bolivian High ( north of the subtropical jet stream). During thunderstorm anvil penetrations, typically at 20 - 40 km horizontal scales, NOx mixing ratios were distinctly enhanced and the absolute mixing ratios varied between 0.2 - 1.6 nmol mol(-1) on average. This enhancement was mainly attributed to NOx production by lightning and partly due to upward transport from the NOx-richer boundary layer. In addition, CO mixing ratios were occasionally enhanced, indicating upward transport from the boundary layer. For the first time, the composition of the anvil outflow from a large, long-lived mesoscale convective system (MCS) advected from northern Argentina and Uruguay was investigated in more detail. Over a horizontal scale of about 400 km, NOx, CO and O-3 absolute mixing ratios were significantly enhanced in these air masses in the range of 0.6 1.1, 110 - 140 and 60 - 70 nmol mol(-1), respectively. Analyses from trace gas correlations and a Lagrangian particle dispersion model indicate that polluted air masses, probably from the Buenos Aires urban area and from biomass burning regions, were uplifted by the MCS. Ozone was distinctly enhanced in the aged MCS outflow, due to photochemical production and entrainment of O-3-rich air masses from the upper troposphere - lower stratosphere region. The aged MCS outflow was transported to the north, ascended and circulated, driven by the Bolivian High over the Amazon basin. In the observed case, the O-3-rich MCS outflow remained over the continent and did not contribute to the South Atlantic ozone maximum.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of the lightning-induced nitrogen oxides (LNOx) source is important for understanding and predicting the nitrogen oxides and ozone distributions in the troposphere and their trends, the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere, and the lifetime of trace gases destroyed by reactions with OH. This knowledge is further required for the assessment of other important NOx sources, in particular from aviation emissions, the stratosphere, and from surface sources, and for understanding the possible feedback between climate changes and lightning. This paper reviews more than 3 decades of research. The review includes laboratory studies as well as surface, airborne and satellite-based observations of lightning and of NOx and related species in the atmosphere. Relevant data available from measurements in regions with strong LNOx influence are identified, including recent observations at midlatitudes and over tropical continents where most lightning occurs. Various methods to model LNOx at cloud scales or globally are described. Previous estimates are re-evaluated using the global annual mean flash frequency of 44+/-5 s(-1) reported from OTD satellite data. From the review, mainly of airborne measurements near thunderstorms and cloud-resolving models, we conclude that a 'typical' thunderstorm flash produces 15 (2-40)x10(25) NO molecules per flash, equivalent to 250 mol NOx or 3.5 kg of N mass per flash with uncertainty factor from 0.13 to 2.7. Mainly as a result of global model studies for various LNOx parameterisations tested with related observations, the best estimate of the annual global LNOx nitrogen mass source and its uncertainty range is (5+/-3) Tg a(-1) in this study. In spite of a smaller global flash rate, the best estimate is essentially the same as in some earlier reviews, implying larger flash-specific NOx emissions. The paper estimates the LNOx accuracy required for various applications and lays out strategies for improving estimates in the future. An accuracy of about 1 Tg a(-1) or 20\%, as necessary in particular for understanding tropical tropospheric chemistry, is still a challenging goal.},

A computational study of the relationships linking lightning frequency and other thundercloud parameters, Q. J. R. Meteorol. Sec., 121, 1525-1548] has been refined and extended, in an effort to provide a more realistic framework from which to examine computationally the relationships that might exist between lightning frequency f (which is now being routinely measured from a satellite, using the NASA/MSFC Optical Transient Detector (OTD)) and a variety of cloud physical parameters. Specifically, superior or more comprehensive representations were utilised of: (1) glaciation via the Hallett-Mossop (H-M) process; (2) the updraught structure of the model cloud; (3) the liquid-water-content structure of the model cloud; (4) the role of the reversal temperature T-rev in influencing lightning characteristics; (5) the critical breakdown field for lightning initiation; and (6) the electrical characteristics of the ice crystal anvil of the model cloud. Although our extended studies yielded some new insights into the problem, the basic pattern of relationships between f and the other parameters was very close to that reported by Baker et al. (1995). The more elaborate treatment of T-rev restricted somewhat the range of conditions under which reverse-polarity lightning could be produced if the cloud glaciated via H-M, but confirmed the earlier conclusion that such lightning would not occur if the glaciation was of the Fletcher type. The computations yielded preliminary support for the hypothesis that satellite measurements of f might be used to determine values of the ice-content of cumulonimbus anvils: a parameter of climatological importance. The successful launch and continuing satisfactory functioning of the OTD [Christian, H.J., Goodman, S., 1992. Global observations of lightning from space, Proc. 9th Int.

Measured global distributions of lightning and associated lightning stroke radiance demonstrate that: lightning activity is particularly pronounced over the tropics, much greater over land than over the oceans, and exhibits great seasonal variability; lightning radiance tends to be greater over the oceans, less when lightning activity is high, and greater in the Northern Hemisphere winter than summer.

The tropical results have led in turn to an examination of thermodynamic climatology over the continental United States in summertime and its comparison with exceptional electrical conditions documented in earlier studies. The tropical and mid-latitude results taken together support an important role for cloud base height in regulating the transfer of convective available potential energy (CAPE) to updraft kinetic energy in thunderstorms. In the tropics, cloud base height is dominated by the dry bulb temperature over the wet bulb temperature as the lightning-regulating temperature in regions characterized by moist convection. In the extratropics, an elevated cloud base height may enable larger cloud water concentrations in the mixed phase region, a favorable condition for the positive charging of large ice particles that may result in thunderclouds with a reversed polarity of the main cloud dipole. The combined requirements of instability and cloud base height serve to confine the region of superlative electrification to the vicinity of the ridge in moist entropy in the western Great Plains.

In this study, cases of positive correlation were found over certain portions of the world by analyzing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products, together with a general finding that DER may increase or decrease with aerosol loading depending on environmental conditions. The slope of the correlation between DER and AOD is driven primarily by water vapor amount, which explains 70\% of the variance in our study. Various potential artifacts that may cause the positive relation are investigated including the effects of aerosol swelling, partially cloudy, atmospheric dynamics, cloud three-dimensional (3-D) and surface influence effects. None seems to be the primary cause for the observed phenomenon, although a certain degree of influence exists for some of the factors. Analyses are conducted over seven regions around the world representing different types of aerosols and clouds. Only two regions show positive dependence of DER on AOD, near coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and South China Sea, which implies physical processes may at work. Using a 2-D Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE) with spectral-bin microphysics which incorporated a reformulation of the Kohler theory, two possible physical mechanisms are hypothesized. They are related to the effects of slightly soluble organics (SSO) particles and giant cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Model simulations show a positive correlation between DER and AOD, due to a decrease in activated aerosols with an increasing SSO content. Addition of a few giant CCNs also increases the DER. Further investigations are needed to fully understand and clarify the observed phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Aerosols affect the Earth's energy budget directly by scattering and absorbing radiation and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei and, thereby, affecting cloud properties. However, large uncertainties exist in current estimates of aerosol forcing because of incomplete knowledge concerning the distribution and the physical and chemical properties of aerosols as well as aerosol-cloud interactions. In recent years, a great deal of effort has gone into improving measurements and datasets. It is thus feasible to shift the estimates of aerosol forcing from largely model-based to increasingly measurement-based. Our goal is to assess current observational capabilities and identify uncertainties in the aerosol direct forcing through comparisons of different methods with independent sources of uncertainties. Here we assess the aerosol optical depth (tau), direct radiative effect (DRE) by natural and anthropogenic aerosols, and direct climate forcing (DCF) by anthropogenic aerosols, focusing on satellite and ground-based measurements supplemented by global chemical transport model CTM) simulations. The multi-spectral MODIS measures global distributions of aerosol optical depth (tau) on a daily scale, with a high accuracy of +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau over ocean. The annual average tau is about 0.14 over global ocean, of which about 21\% +/- 7\% is contributed by human activities, as estimated by MODIS fine-mode fraction. The multi-angle MISR derives an annual average AOD of 0.23 over global land with an uncertainty of similar to 20\% or +/- 0.05. These high-accuracy aerosol products and broadband flux measurements from CERES make it feasible to obtain observational constraints for the aerosol direct effect, especially over global the ocean. A number of measurement-based approaches estimate the clear-sky DRE ( on solar radiation) at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) to be about - 5.5 +/- 0.2 W m(-2) ( median +/- standard error from various methods) over the global ocean. Accounting for thin cirrus contamination of the satellite derived aerosol field will reduce the TOA DRE to -5.0 W m(-2). Because of a lack of measurements of aerosol absorption and difficulty in characterizing land surface reflection, estimates of DRE over land and at the ocean surface are currently realized through a combination of satellite retrievals, surface measurements, and model simulations, and are less constrained. Over the oceans the surface DRE is estimated to be - 8.8 +/- 0.7W m(-2). Over land, an integration of satellite retrievals and model simulations derives a DRE of - 4.9 +/- 0.7W m(-2) and - 11.8 +/- 1.9W m(-2) at the TOA and surface, respectively. CTM simulations derive a wide range of DRE estimates that on average are smaller than the measurement-based DRE by about 30 - 40\%, even after accounting for thin cirrus and cloud contamination.A number of issues remain. Current estimates of the aerosol direct effect over land are poorly constrained. Uncertainties of DRE estimates are also larger on regional scales than on a global scale and large discrepancies exist between different approaches. The characterization of aerosol absorption and vertical distribution remains challenging. The aerosol direct effect in the thermal infrared range and in cloudy conditions remains relatively unexplored and quite uncertain, because of a lack of global systematic aerosol vertical profile measurements. A coordinated research strategy needs to be developed for integration and assimilation of satellite measurements into models to constrain model simulations. Enhanced measurement capabilities in the next few years and high-level scientific cooperation will further advance our knowledge.},

The monthly MODIS data used here are accumulated measurements across a wide range of view and scattering angles and represent the aerosol's spectrally resolved angular properties. We use these data consistently to compute with estimated accuracy of +/- 0.6 Wm(-2) the reflected sunlight by the aerosol over global oceans in cloud free conditions. The MODIS high spatial resolution (0.5 km) allows observation of the aerosol impact between clouds that can be missed by other sensors with larger footprints. We found that over the clear-sky global ocean the aerosol reflected 5.3 +/- 0.6 Wm(-2) with an average radiative efficiency of -49 +/- 2 Wm(-2) per unit optical thickness.

	abstract = {Using an analysis of the first full year of CALIPSO lidar measurements, this paper derives unprecedented, altitude-resolved seasonal distributions of desert dust transported over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the surrounding areas. The CALIPSO lidar observations include numerous large dust plumes over the northern slope and eastern part of the TP, with the largest number of dust events occurring in the spring of 2007, and some layers being lofted to altitudes of 11-12 km. Generation of the Tibetan airborne dusts appears to be largely associated with source regions to the north and on the eastern part of the plateau. Examination of the CALIPSO time history reveals an "airborne dust corridor" due to the eastward transport of dusts originating primarily in these source areas. This corridor extends from west to east and shows a seasonality largely modulated by the TP through its dynamical and thermal forcing on the atmospheric flows. On the southern side, desert dust particles originate predominately in Northwest India and Pakistan. The dust transport occurs primarily in dry seasons around the TP western and southern slopes and dust particles become mixed with local polluted aerosols. No significant amount of dust appears to be transported over the Himalayas. Extensive forward trajectory simulations are also conducted to confirm the dust transport pattern from the nearby sources observed by the CALIPSO lidar. Comparisons with the OMI and MODIS measurements show the unique capability of the CALIPSO lidar to provide unambiguous, altitude-resolved dust measurements.},

	abstract = {Based on the first year of CALIPSO lidar measurements under cloud-free conditions, a height-resolved global distribution of dust aerosols is presented for the first time. Results indicate that spring is the most active dust season, during which similar to 20\% and similar to 12\% of areas between 0 and 60 degrees N are influenced by dust at least 10\% and 50\% of the time, respectively. In summer within 3-6 km, similar to 8.3\% of area between 0 and 60 degrees N is impacted by dust at least 50\% of the time. Strong seasonal cycles of dust layer vertical extent are observed in major source regions, which are similar to the seasonal variation of the thermally driven boundary layer depth. The arid and semiarid areas in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula are the most persistent and prolific dust sources. African dust is transported across the Atlantic all yearlong with strong seasonal variation in the transport pathways mainly in the free troposphere in summer and at the low altitudes in winter. However, the trans-Atlantic dust is transported at the low altitudes is important for all seasons, especially transported further cross the ocean. The crossing Atlantic dusty zones are shifted southward from summer to winter, which is accompanied by a similar southward shift of dust-generating areas over North Africa. The Taklimakan and Gobi deserts are two major dust sources in East Asia with long-range transport mainly occurring in spring. The large horizontal and vertical coverage of dust aerosols indicate their importance in the climate system through both direct and indirect aerosol effects.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosol particles serve as condensation nuclei for the formation of both, cloud droplets and atmospheric ice particles. As a result, they exert a substantial influence on the microphysical properties of water and ice clouds, which in turn affect the processes that lead to the formation of rain, snow, hail, and other forms of precipitation. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the chemical composition of aerosols, their microphysical properties, and the factors that enable them to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN). The first part of this review article will focus on the nature and sources of CCN and IN. We discuss the fundamentals of the cloud droplet and ice nucleation processes, and the role that the chemical composition and particle size play in this process. We show that, in many instances, the influence of chemical composition can be represented by a simple parameterization, which leaves particle size as the main variable controlling CCN efficiency.Aerosol particles are produced either directly by anthropogenic and natural sources (dust, sea salt, soot, biological particles, etc.), or they are formed in the atmosphere by condensation of low-volatility compounds (e.g., sulfuric acid or oxidized organic compounds). We discuss the magnitude of these sources, and the CCN and IN characteristics of the particles they produce. In contrast to previous assessments, which focused on the aerosol mass, we are emphasizing the number of particles being produced, as this is the key variable in cloud microphysics. Large uncertainties still exist for many aerosol sources, e.g., the submicron part of the seaspray aerosol, the particles produced by the biosphere, and the secondary organic aerosol. We conclude with a discussion on what particle concentrations may have been in the pristine atmosphere, before the onset on anthropogenic pollution. Model calculations and observations in remote continental regions consistently suggest that CCN concentrations over the pristine continents were similar to those now prevailing over the remote oceans, suggesting that human activities have modified cloud microphysics more than what is reflected in conventional wisdom. The second part of this review will address the effects of changing CCN and IN abundances on precipitation processes, the water cycle, and climate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A new conceptual model that facilitates the inference of the vigor of severe convective storms, producing tornadoes and large hail, by using satellite- retrieved vertical profiles of cloud top temperature ( T) - particle effective radius ( r(e)) relations is presented and tested. The driving force of these severe weather phenomena is the high updraft speed, which can sustain the growth of large hailstones and provide the upward motion that is necessary to evacuate the violently converging air of a tornado. Stronger updrafts are revealed by the delayed growth of re to greater heights and lower T, because there is less time for the cloud and raindrops to grow by coalescence. The strong updrafts also delay the development of a mixed phase cloud and its eventual glaciation to colder temperatures. Analysis of case studies making use of these and related criteria show that they can be used to identify clouds that possess a significant risk of large hail and tornadoes. Although the strength and direction of the wind shear are major modulating factors, it appears that they are manifested in the updraft intensity and cloud shapes and hence in the T-r(e) profiles. It is observed that the severe storm T-r(e) signature is an extensive property of the clouds that develop ahead in space and time of the actual hail or tornadic storm, suggesting that the probabilities of large hail and tornadoes can be obtained at substantial lead times. Analysis of geostationary satellite time series indicates lead times of up to 2 h.},

	abstract = {Clouds developing in a polluted environment tend to have more numerous but smaller droplets. This property may lead to suppression of precipitation and longer cloud lifetime. Absorption of incoming solar radiation by aerosols, however, can reduce the cloud cover. The net aerosol effect on clouds is currently the largest uncertainty in evaluating climate forcing. Using large statistics of 1-km resolution MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) satellite data, we study the aerosol effect on shallow water clouds, separately in four regions of the Atlantic Ocean, for June through August 2002: marine aerosol (30 degrees S-20 degrees S), smoke (20 degrees S-5 degrees N), mineral dust (5 degrees N-25 degrees N), and pollution aerosols (30 degrees N160 degrees N). All four aerosol types affect the cloud droplet size. We also find that the coverage of shallow clouds increases in all of the cases by 0.2-0.4 from clean to polluted, smoky, or dusty conditions. Covariability analysis with meteorological parameters associates most of this change to aerosol, for each of the four regions and 3 months studied. In our opinion, there is low probability that the net aerosol effect can be explained by coincidental, unresolved, changes in meteorological conditions that also accumulate aerosol, or errors in the data, although further in situ measurements and model developments are needed to fully understand the processes. The radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere incurred by the aerosol effect on the shallow clouds and solar radiation is -11 +/- 3 W/m(2) for the 3 months studied; 2/3 of it is due to the aerosol-induced cloud changes, and 1/3 is due to aerosol direct radiative effect.},

	abstract = {In situ airborne measurements obtained in convective clouds in the vicinity of the Marshall Islands on 15 days in July and August 1999 are used to determine the microphysical structures and precipitation-producing mechanisms in these clouds. The liquid water contents of the clouds were generally well below adiabatic values, even in newly risen turrets. This is attributed to the entrainment of ambient air and to the very efficient removal of cloud water by the collision and coalescence of drops. The formation of raindrops began when the concentration of droplets with radii {\textgreater} 15 mu m exceeded similar to 3 cm(-3) or, equivalently, when the effective cloud drop radius reached similar to 13 mu m. Clouds rained when their depth exceeded similar to 1.5 km. Due to rainout, the effective radius of cloud droplets began decreasing similar to 2-4 km above cloud base.Extremely high concentrations of ice particles (often {\textgreater} 500 litre(-1)) formed very rapidly at temperatures between -4 and -10 degrees C. High-resolution imagery of these particles, which were primarily sheaths, needles, frozen drops and irregular ice fragments, indicates that the high concentrations of ice were initiated by the freezing of individual drops, some of which fragmented upon freezing, accompanied by ice splinter production during riming. However, for ice particles {\textless} 100 mu m in maximum dimension, frozen drops and ice fragments were much more numerous than columnar ice crystals, the latter being indicative of ice splinter production. Narrow (10-50 m wide) streamers of precipitation containing large ({\textgreater} 3 mm diameter) solid and liquid particles were often encountered in growing clouds. It is proposed that the particles in these streamers grew rapidly by riming in water-rich zones and, under appropriate conditions, the ice particles produced by both drop fragmentation and riming resulted in exceptionally high localized concentrations of ice. Convective clouds consisting entirely of liquid water produced rain rates that were similar to those from deep convective clouds containing ice.Since the concentration of drizzle and raindrops within a few kilometres of cloud base was highly correlated with cloud depth, and therefore cloud top temperature, the concentration of raindrops in cumulus and cumulo-nimbus clouds over the warm pool of the tropical Pacific Ocean can be inferred from satellite measurements of cloud top temperatures.},

It was observed that the microwave absorption coefficient in the bright band (melting layer) in the stratiform rainfall was roughly twice or thrice that of the rain below. Radiative transfer models of the melting layer have a similar range of uncertainties. In addition to the potential bias from modeling uncertainties, comparison with previous observations suggests that there is a natural variability of about the same magnitude.The aircraft also made penetrations of a convective line at altitudes of 2.6, 3.4, and 4.5 km. From the microwave observations, it can be concluded that the effect of supercooled water above the freezing level was extremelv small, on the order of 2\% or less of the total rain signal for this case.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a cloud-resolving modeling study concerning the impact of warm-rain microphysics on convective-radiative quasi equilibrium with fixed surface characteristics and prescribed solar input, both mimicking the mean conditions on earth. Two limits of the concentration of cloud droplets, either 100 cm(-3) (referred to as "pristine") or 1000 cm(-3) (referred to as "polluted"), are considered. In addition, three formulations of the effective radius of water droplets in diluted cloudy volumes are used, corresponding to the homogeneous, intermediate, and extremely inhomogeneous mixing scenarios. The assumed concentration of cloud droplets, together with the assumed mixing scenario, affects the local value of the effective radius of cloud droplets (the first indirect aerosol effect, also known as the Twomey effect) and the transfer of cloud water into drizzle and rain, which can affect the mean cloudiness and the hydrologic cycle (the second indirect effect).The convective-radiative quasi equilibrium mimics the estimates of globally and annually averaged water and energy fluxes across the earth's atmosphere to within less than 10 W m(-2). As on earth, the model cloudiness is dominated by shallow convection. It is found that the impact of warm microphysics is dominated by the first indirect effect, whereas the second indirect effect has a smaller impact. The assumed droplet concentration and mixing scenario impact the mean "planetary" albedo and, thus, the amount of solar energy reaching the surface, with all other components of atmospheric energy and water budgets virtually the same in all simulations. The weak second indirect effect highlights the difference between the impact of cloud microphysics on a single cloud and the impact on an ensemble of clouds, with only the latter including the feedbacks between clouds and their environment. The formulation of the effective radius in the diluted cloudy volumes turns out to be of critical importance, with the amount of solar energy reaching the surface being the same in the pristine case assuming the homogeneous mixing scenario and in the polluted case with the extremely inhomogeneous mixing. This result emphasizes the essential role of poorly understood microphysical transformations within diluted convective clouds, which strongly impact the magnitude of the first indirect (Twomey) effect. Implications for future research in this area are discussed.},

The winds in the new eyewall are initially weaker than those in the original eyewall, but as the new eyewall contracts, the storm reintensifies. Understanding this replacement mechanism is vital to forecasting variations in hurricane intensity. Processes in the "moat" region between the new and old eyewall have been particularly unclear. Aircraft data now show that the moat becomes dynamically similar to the eye and thus is converted into a region inimical to survival of the inner eyewall. We suggest that targeting aircraft to key parts of the storm to gain crucial input to high-resolution numerical models can lead to improvements in forecasting hurricane intensity.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional structure of summer monsoon convection in the Himalayan region and its overall variability are examined by analyzing data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar over the June-September seasons of 2002 and 2003. Statistics are compiled for both convective and stratiform components of the observed radar echoes.Deep intense convective echoes (40 dBZ echo reaching heights {\textgreater} 10 km) occur primarily just upstream (south) of and over the lower elevations of the Himalayan barrier, especially in the northwestern concave indentation of the barrier. The deep intense convective echoes are vertically erect, consistent with the relatively weak environmental shear. They sometimes extend above 17 km, indicating that exceptionally strong updraughts loft graupel to high altitudes. Occasionally, scattered isolated deep intense convective echoes occur over the Tibetan Plateau.Wide intense convective echoes (40 dBZ echo {\textgreater} 1000 km(2) in horizontal dimension) also occur preferentially just upstream of and over the lower elevations of the Himalayas, most frequently in the northwestern indentation of the barrier. The wide intense echoes have an additional tendency to occur along the central portion of the Himalayas, and they seldom if ever occur over the Tibetan Plateau. The wide intense echoes exhibit three mesoscale structures: amorphous areas, lines parallel to the mountain barrier, and arc-shaped squall lines perpendicular to and propagating parallel to the steep Himalayan barrier. The latter are rare, generally weaker than those seen in other parts of the world, and occur when a midlevel jet is aligned with the Himalayan escarpment.Deep and wide intense convective echoes over the northwestern subcontinent tend to occur where the low-level moist layer of monsoon air from the Arabian Sea meets dry downslope flow, in a manner reminiscent of severe convection leeward of the Rocky Mountains in the central USA. As the low-level layer of moist air from the sea moves over the hot and northwestern subcontinent, it is capped by an elevated layer of dry air advected off the Afghan or Tibetan Plateau. The capped low-level monsoonal airflow accumulates instability via surface heating until this instability is released by orographically induced lifting immediately adjacent to or directly over the foothills of the Himalayas.Broad ({\textgreater}50000 km(2) in area) stratiform echoes occur in the eastern and central portions of the Himalayan region in connection with Bay of Bengal depressions. Their centroids are most frequent just upstream of the Himalayas, in the region of the concave indentation of the barrier at the eastern end of the range. The steep topography apparently enhances the formation and longevity of the broad stratiform echoes. Monsoonal depressions provide a moist maritime environment for the convection, evidently allowing mesoscale systems to develop larger stratiform echoes than in the western Himalayan region.

	abstract = {Measurements of ice crystal growth under free fail in a generation of vertical supercooled cloud tunnels and some static cloud chambers as well as the related theoretical works are summarized.Growth parameters, that is, mass (m), dimensions, apparent density, and fall velocity (w), show extrema at about -5 degrees, -10 degrees, and -15 degrees C where crystals are predominantly column-needle, isometric, and plate-stellardendrite, respectively. Crystal shape enhances with time (t) at about -5 degrees and -15 degrees C- whereas at -10 degrees C the effect is minimal and crystals show strongest tendency to grow into graupel due to the fail velocity maximum discovered early in the series of present studies. At this temperature, switch-over of growth mode toward graupel occurs more quickly as liquid water content (W-t,) increases. Under a fixed cloud condition, the shape-enhanced crystals hardly grow into graupel and vice versa.The diffusional growth theory, with Maxwellian surface condition and without ventilation. describes well the behaviors of intermediate size crystals for which m proportional to t(3/2) proportional to (-w)(3/2) proportional to (-z)(3/4), being the fail distance, is identified. Small crystals grow more slowly due to accommodation coefficient effects and larger ones grow faster due to enhanced ventilation; and riming. To include these effects, a generalized growth theory is formulated. r{\textbackslash} simple theory is developed for graupel/hail growth where m proportional to p(u) (3)(W(L)t)(6) proportional to (-z)(3) . P-u being the air density. Based on these relationships, the dominance of diffusional grou th mechanism for precipitation development in,shallow convectively weak, winter clouds and that of graupel/hail-type riming growth in deep, convectively strong, summer clouds is explained.},

	abstract = {Reflectivity data from Doppler radars are used to construct vertical profiles of radar reflectivity (VPRR) of convective cells in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in three different environmental regimes. The National Center for Atmospheric Research CP-3 and CP-4 radars are used to calculate median VPRR for MCSs in the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central in 1985. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere radar in Darwin, Australia, is used to calculate VPRR for MCSs observed both in oceanic, monsoon regimes and in continental, break period regimes during the wet seasons of 1987/88 and 1988/89.The midlatitude and tropical continental VPRRs both exhibit maximum reflectivity somewhat above the surface and have a gradual decrease in reflectivity with height above the freezing level. In sharp contrast, the tropical oceanic profile has a maximum reflectivity at the lowest level and a very rapid decrease in reflectivity with height beginning just above the freezing level. The tropical oceanic profile in the Darwin area is almost the same shape as that for two other tropical oceanic regimes, leading to the conclusion that it is characteristic.The absolute values of reflectivity in the 0-degrees to -20-degrees-C range are compared with values in the literature thought to represent a threshold for rapid storm electrification leading to lightning, about 40 dBZ at - 10-degrees-C. Most oceanic cells have reflectivities below the threshold; most midlatitude continental cells exceed the threshold, and the tropical continental cells are about equally divided above and below the threshold. The large negative vertical gradient of reflectivity in this temperature range for oceanic storms is hypothesized to be a direct result of the characteristically weaker vertical velocities observed in MCSs over tropical oceans. It is proposed, as a necessary condition for rapid electrification, that a convective cell must have its updraft speed exceed some threshold value. Based upon field program data, a tentative estimate for the magnitude of this threshold is 6-7 m s-1 for mean speed and 10(-12) m s-1 for peak speed.},

	abstract = {The thunderstorm frequency over the oceans during the Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment is quantified by examination of over 20000 surface hourly observations from research ships. The overall thunderstorm frequency is one thunderstorm day per ship per month. There were many examples of intense mesoscale systems. such as squall lines, passing over the ships, extending to 13-17 km in altitude, but that nevertheless produce few reports of lightning. This reinforces the idea, based on data from other tropical ocean regions and from global satellite data, that in spite of the ubiquitous ”hot towers” over tropical oceans, marine cumulonimbus produce little lightning.Climatological data from the monsoon regions of the Tropics are analyzed to reveal that during periods of onshore flow and heavy rainfall the oceanic regime of high rainfall but little lightning moves onshore. A rain-thunderstorm ratio is defined and used to characterize convective rainfall regimes as continental (relatively little) or maritime (relatively great) rainfall compared to the number of thunderstorm days. In regions such as West Africa and south Asia, the seasonal rainfall peak is actually accompanied by a thunderstorm minimum.It is further suggested that the data support the idea, not original here, that vertical velocities in oceanic cumulonimbus clouds tend to be low compared with continental clouds. Radar data from the companion paper in this issue are also consistent with this idea. It is hypothesized that most oceanic storms have updrafts weaker than a possible threshold value, below which the supercooled liquid water, large ice particles, and ice-ice collisions are not present in the mixed-phase region in sufficient concentrations for electrification leading to lightning.},

	abstract = {Precipitation processes in convective storms are potentially a major regulator of cloud feedback. An unresolved issue is how the partitioning of convective condensate between precipitation-size particles that fall out of updrafts and smaller particles that are detrained to form anvil clouds will change as the climate warms. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations of tropical oceanic convective storms indicate higher precipitation efficiency at warmer sea surface temperature (SST) but also suggest that cumulus anvil sizes, albedos, and ice water paths become insensitive to warming at high temperatures. International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data show that instantaneous cirrus and deep convective cloud fractions are positively correlated and increase with SST except at the highest temperatures, but are sensitive to variations in large-scale vertical velocity. A simple conceptual model based on a Marshall-Palmer drop size distribution, empirical terminal velocity-particle size relationships, and assumed cumulus updraft speeds reproduces the observed tendency for detrained condensate to approach a limiting value at high SST. These results suggest that the climatic behavior of observed tropical convective clouds is intermediate between the extremes required to support the thermostat and adaptive iris hypotheses.},

	abstract = {In the spring of 1998, numerous fires from seasonal biomass burning in Central America, mainly in Mexico and Guatemala, produced aerosol particles that were advected into the central plains of the United States. The effects of the fires continued from approximately April 9 through June 11. The most intense smoke concentration was on May 8 as seen from a NASA Shuttle mission. Characteristics of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes recorded by the National Lightning Detection Network were examined for May 1998 by subtracting the lightning characteristics for May 1995-1997, and 1999 This produces "difference value" maps with approximately 100 km resolution for polarity, peak currents, and multiplicity. Several significant differences are revealed. The percentage of positive flashes increased by a factor of two. Median first stroke peak currents have been calculated for both positive and negative flashes. For negative flashes, the median peak current decreased during the fire period. For positive flashes, the median peak current increased by over 20 kA in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Nebraska. Mean multiplicity values, or the number of strokes per flash, were calculated. Positive flash multiplicity did not change. Mean multiplicity values for negative flashes, however, changed dramatically. For a region including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Louisiana multiplicity values for negative flashes decreased from 2.8 to 1.0-1.4 strokes per flash. The data analyzed were a corrected set from which we had deleted positive flashes with peak currents less than 10 kA, thus removing most of the intracloud contamination. Further studies may reveal the relation between the effect of pollution and aerosol size on the characteristics of CG flashes.},

	abstract = {We have constructed profiles of lightning NOx mass distribution for use in specifying the effective lightning NOx source in global and regional chemical transport models. The profiles have been estimated for midlatitude continental, tropical continental, and tropical marine regimes based on profiles computed for individual storms in each regime. In order to construct these profiles we have developed a parameterization for lightning occurrence, lightning type, flash placement, and NOx production in a cloud-scale tracer transport model using variables computed in the two-dimensional Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model. Wind fields from the GCE model are used to redistribute the lightning NOx throughout the duration of the storm. Our method produces reasonable results in terms of computed flash rates and NOx mixing ratios compared with observations. The profiles for each storm are computed by integrating the lightning NOx mass across the cloud model domain for each model layer at the end of the: storm. The results for all three regimes show a maximum in the mass profile in the upper troposphere, usually within 2-4 km of the tropopause. Downdrafts appear to be the strongest in the simulated midlatitude continental systems, evidenced by substantial lightning NOx mass (up to 23\%) in the lowest kilometer. Tropical systems, particularly those over marine areas, tended to have a greater fraction of intracloud flashes and weaker downdrafts, causing only minor amounts of NOx to remain in the boundary layer following a storm. Minima appear in the profiles typically in the 2-5 km layer. Even though a substantial portion of the NOx is produced by cloud-to-ground flashes in the lowest 6 km, at the end of the storm most of the NOx is in the upper troposphere (55-75\% above 8 km) in agreement with observations. With most of the effective lightning NOx source in the upper troposphere where the NOx lifetime is several days, substantial photochemical O-3 production is expected in this layer downstream of regions of deep convection containing lightning. We demonstrate that the effect on upper tropospheric NOx and O-3 is substantial when the vertical distribution of the lightning NOx source in a global model is changed from uniform to being specified by our profiles. Uncertainties in a number of aspects of our parameterization are discussed.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric O-3 is an important greenhouse gas. Lightning is a major source of NOx, and thus of tropospheric O-3. It has recently been suggested that due to an apparent strong correlation between lightning strike rates and surface temperatures, tropospheric O-3 may significantly increase if the climate warms, resulting in a substantial positive climate forcing. This paper attempts to quantify the extent of this forcing and the associated positive climate feedback. Simulations incorporating a tropospheric O-3-surface temperature parameterization are performed of the last glacial maximum and of a climate in which greenhouse gas concentrations have been doubled. The O-3 parameterization is based on results from a two-dimensional chemical model. The simulations are obtained using a one-dimensional radiative-convective model, in which CO2, CH4, tropospheric O-3, and in the case of the paleoclimate simulation the surface albedo, are varied both independently and in combination. In the paleoclimate case, the tropospheric O-3 feedback has roughly two thirds of the effect on surface temperatures as the change in tropospheric O-3 due to industrialization alone. During climate warming, the effect on surface temperatures is about 60\% of that due to a doubling of CH4. The results indicate that a surface temperature-lightning-O-3 feed-back, currently absent in general circulation models, could significantly affect anthropogenic climate change. Improved modeling and observations are required to confirm this.},

It is shown that changes in global monthly land lightning activity are well correlated with changes in global monthly land wet-bulb temperatures. The correlation is strongest in the northern hemisphere and weak in the southern hemisphere. The conclusion is that a high land-area to sea-area ratio is necessary for a good correlation. Contrary to expectation, the tropics show no correlation. The results predict that a change in the average land wet-bulb temperature of the globe of just 1K would result in a change in lightning activity of about 40\%.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone is an important greenhouse gas. In the upper troposphere one of the major sources of ozone are the nitrogen oxides produced by lightning [IPCC, 1995]. Recently it has been shown that the number of lightning flashes may be very sensitive to changes in the surface temperature [Williams, 1992]. Here we use a global two-dimensional atmospheric model and find that for a warmer surface and constant lightning ozone decreases globally except for in the polluted Northern Hemisphere. However, a warming with increased lightning can more than offset this decrease. We find that for a 20\% increase of lightning the global mean radiative forcing by tropospheric ozone is about +0.1 Wm(-2). There is therefore a possibility of a positive climate feedback mechanism. The implied sensitivity of ozone to lightning and temperature suggests a major uncertainty in quantifying anthropogenic perturbations of upper tropospheric ozone.},

The year 2100 CO2 concentration as well as the anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors and aerosols/aerosol precursors are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2. Year 2100 global O-3 and aerosol burdens predicted with changes in both climate and emissions are generally 5-20\% lower than those simulated with changes in emissions alone; as exceptions, the nitrate burden is 38\% lower, and the secondary organic aerosol burden is 17\% higher. Although the CO2-driven climate change alone is predicted to reduce the global O-3 burden as a result of faster removal of O-3 in a warmer climate, it is predicted to increase surface layer O-3 concentrations over or near populated and biomass burning areas because of slower transport, enhanced biogenic hydrocarbon emissions, decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate at higher temperatures, and the increase of O-3 production by increased water vapor at high NOx levels. The warmer climate influences aerosol burdens by increasing aerosol wet deposition, altering climate-sensitive emissions, and shifting aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium. Climate change affects the estimates of the year 2100 direct radiative forcing as a result of the climate-induced changes in burdens and different climatological conditions; with full gas-aerosol coupling and accounting for ozone and aerosols from both natural and anthropogenic sources, year 2100 global mean top of the atmosphere direct radiative forcings by O-3, sulfate, nitrate, black carbon, and organic carbon are predicted to be + 0.93, - 0.72, - 1.0, + 1.26, and - 0.56 W m(-2), respectively, using present-day climate and year 2100 emissions, while they are predicted to be + 0.76, - 0.72, - 0.74, + 0.97, and - 0.58 W m(-2), respectively, with year 2100 climate and emissions.},

The turbulent variability of relative humidity near the boundary-layer top is formulated in terms of dry air entrainment. The mesoscale subgrid variability is specified as a function of horizontal grid size based on HAPEX analyses. The cloud cover formulation is applied in a one-dimensional atmospheric boundary-layer model. However, the modelled cloud cover is found to be more sensitive to the specified mean vertical motion than to the adjustable coefficients in the cloud cover formulation.},

This evolution is thought to control the development of boundary layer clouds. This study examines the dependence of boundary layer relative humidity on soil moisture, large-scale vertical motion, and the moisture content and temperature stratification above the boundary layer. The response of the boundary layer relative humidity to external forcing involves competing mechanisms and the net effect on relative humidity is difficult to predict without complete analysis of the relative humidity tendency equation.As one example, drier soil leads to smaller boundary layer specific humidity but also leads to cooler temperatures at the boundary layer top due to greater boundary layer growth. When the latter effect dominates, the relative humidity at the boundary layer top is greater over drier soil. In contrast, drier soil leads to lower relative humidity at the boundary layer top when the air above the boundary layer is strongly stratified or quite dry. These and other nonlinear interactions are posed in terms of a detailed analysis of the budget equation for boundary layer top relative humidity.},

Mean RPF values averaged over the entire TRMM region are 3.94 x 10(8) kg fl(-1) over land and 1.96 x 10(9) kg fl(-1) over oceans. A good (- 0.55) correlation between RPF and the Tall Convective Rain Contribution with a threshold of - 20 degC (TCRC - 20C) was found especially over land.

This study is focused on high-level ice clouds. The MODIS-derived high clouds are classified as cirriform and deep convective clouds using the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) classification scheme. Cirriform clouds make up more than 80\% of the total high clouds, whereas deep convective clouds account for less than 20\% of the total high clouds. High clouds are prevalent over the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ), tropical Africa, the Indian Ocean, tropical America, and South America.

In the present light scattering and radiative transfer simulations, the ice fraction is assumed to be vertically homogeneous; the habit (shape) percentage as a function of ice particle size is consistent with that used for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational (Collection 4 and earlier) cloud products; and the surface is assumed to be Lambertian with an albedo of 0.03. Furthermore, error analyses are performed that pertain to the inference of the mixed-phase cloud effective particle size and optical thickness. Errors are calculated with respect to the assumption of a cloud containing solely liquid or ice phase particles.

	abstract = {[ 1] A new effective particle size (R-eff) parameterization for ice clouds has been formulated based on depth into cloud relative to cloud top. This parameterization has been developed based on an extensive data set of lidar and radar ice cloud retrievals. Using this parameterization within the stand-alone radiation code from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (cy23r4), the performance of the new parameterization is compared with the more commonly used parameterizations based on temperature and/or ice water content. An evaluation is performed on the basis of observed shortwave fluxes for 13 days with persistent ice cloud decks, with no liquid clouds beneath, over the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research in the Netherlands. For each of these clouds the shortwave flux is calculated after which the distribution of the differences between the observed and modeled shortwave fluxes from the combined 13 days are compared with each other. The new parameterization shows a median absolute difference of 0.7 W m(-2) relative to the observations. The control parameterization based on temperature shows a median absolute difference of 15 W m(-2). Within the framework of the KNMI regional climate model (RACMO2), the new parameterization yields an effective particle size versus temperature distribution very similar to the observed distributions from lidar and radar retrievals. Results from a 1-year integration indicate that the domain averaged monthly mean planetary albedo and transmissivity change by a maximum of 2.6 and 2.4\%, respectively, using the new parameterization compared to the temperature-based parameterization.},

The scheme is based on polynomial fits to the results from a more elaborate scheme recently developed by the third author. The scheme assumes a temperature dependency of ice crystal size and is able to handle five different crystal shapes. We first carry out sensitivity experiments highlighting the direct ("noninteractive") forcing effect of the new scheme for different assumptions on ice crystal shape and size. It is found that the effects of crystal shape and size are of comparable importance in determining the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. We have further conducted multiyear simulations with full dynamic coupling. In these experiments we have chosen planar polycrystals as our basic crystal shape. Compared to control integrations with columns in one case and 30 mu m spheres in the other, we find a reduction in the cold biases of the models in the upper tropical troposphere. This is shown to be mainly due to enhanced longwave radiative warming there, caused by the presence of smaller ice crystals. The upper tropospheric warming affects tropical convection in such a way that moisture and ice water distributions are modified. Consequently, relative humidity biases are somewhat reduced in both models. In one of the models there is a significant improvement in the longwave radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere, while in the other, the radiative budget remains in fairly close agreement with observations.},

The comparison between lidar-derived and in situ - derived extinction values shows that they are strongly correlated for the two different lidar-based methods.

	abstract = {This study used the 85-GHz ice scattering signature to describe the size, intensity, and geographic distribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) between 35 degrees N and 35 degrees S for January, April, Jury, and October 1993. An MCS was defined as an area below 250 K of at least 2000 km(2), with an enclosed minimum brightness temperature below 225 K. The geographic distribution of MCSs identified by these criteria was consistent with large-scale seasonal dynamics. There was no significant relationship (R(2) approximate to 0.05) between the size and intensity for the MCSs in the study database. Tropical South America, tropical Africa, and the oceanic warm pool had the greatest number of MCSs. Equatorial regions such as tropical Africa had the smallest median areas. The subtropical oceans had the largest median areas, about 20\% greater than other regions. MCSs in the continental regions tended to have colder minimum brightness temperatures than MCSs in the oceanic regions. The subtropical oceans had the warmest median minimum brightness temperatures, and tropical Africa had the coldest. Sunrise/sunset stratification of the data provided additional insight into land-water differences. MCSs were 35\% more frequent over the oceans at sunrise than at sunset and 60\% more frequent over tropical continents at sunset than at sunrise. Except over the subtropical oceans, MCSs tended lo be larger al sunrise than at sunset. Continental MCSs tended to be colder at sunset than sunrise and colder than oceanic MCSs, particularly at sunset. The minimum brightness temperatures of oceanic MCSs tended to be only marginally colder at sunrise than at sunset. In general, continental MCSs appeared to be smaller and more intense than oceanic MCSs, and the largest and the most intense MCSs occurred more frequently in the subtropics.},

The parameterization thus allows the flexibility of varying the ice water path and effective radius independently of each other. The parameterized optical properties are used to calculate the bulk reflectivity, transmissivity, and emissivity for cirrus clouds with realistic ranges of IWP and r(e). For a given change in cloud optical depth a change in r(e) alone is more effective than a change in IWP alone in altering the shortwave reflectivity and therefore in altering the strength of the cloud albedo feedback.},

Focusing on the Amazon, we show a smooth transition between two opposing effects of aerosols on clouds: the microphysical and the radiative. We show how a feedback between the optical properties of aerosols and the cloud fraction can modify the aerosol forcing, changing the total radiative energy and redistributing it over the atmospheric column.},

	abstract = {Measurements of aerosol composition in the eastern Mediterranean reveal that sulfate is found in most aerosol particles. Some of the large particles contain mixtures of chemicals such as sulfate and sea salt. The most striking observation is the discovery that mineral dust particles often get coated with sulfate and other soluble materials. The amount of soluble material on these particles is found to be related to their surface area, suggesting that the deposition process could be surface dependent. The mechanism by which sulfate is found on some of the mineral dust particles is believed to originate from evaporating cloud drops, which were originally nucleated on sulfate cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and subsequently collected dry interstitial mineral dust particles. The presence of soluble material on mineral dust particles, converts the latter into effective giant CCN. This is further corroborated by the fact that the few large drops near the bases of convective clouds near the coast of Israel sometimes contain both dust and sulfate. Calculations show that the presence of such large CCN could be instrumental in producing large drops (20-40 mu m), which would accelerate precipitation development through drop growth by collection. Ice crystal concentration in these types of clouds was found to be much higher than expected based on previously reported measurements of ice nuclei. These high concentrations are believed to be produced by one or more of the ice multiplication processes such as the Hallett-Mossop mechanism and/or the enhanced nucleation of ice under supersaturation conditions. Both ice multiplication mechanisms are possible when large drops are formed. These findings point out that many of the rain clouds in this region have mixed characteristics (between maritime and continental).Since cloud seeding with ice nuclei attempts to increase ice crystal content in the clouds in order to enhance rain, the use of such seeding techniques in these clouds seems to be fruitless since any additional ice would not enhance rain or may even reduce it.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional cloud-resolving model with detailed spectral bin microphysics is used to examine the effect of aerosols on three different deep convective cloud systems that developed in different geographic locations: south Florida, Oklahoma, and the central Pacific. A pair of model simulations, one with an idealized low cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) (clean) and one with an idealized high CCN (dirty environment), is conducted for each case. In all three cases, rain reaches the ground earlier for the low-CCN case. Rain suppression is also evident in all three cases with high CCN. However, this suppression only occurs during the early stages of the simulations. During the mature stages of the simulations the effects of increasing aerosol concentration range from rain suppression in the Oklahoma case to almost no effect in the Florida case to rain enhancement in the Pacific case. The model results suggest that evaporative cooling in the lower troposphere is a key process in determining whether high CCN reduces or enhances precipitation. Stronger evaporative cooling can produce a stronger cold pool and thus stronger low-level convergence through interactions with the low-level wind shear. Consequently, precipitation processes can be more vigorous. For example, the evaporative cooling is more than two times stronger in the lower troposphere with high CCN for the Pacific case. Sensitivity tests also suggest that ice processes are crucial for suppressing precipitation in the Oklahoma case with high CCN. A comparison and review of other modeling studies are also presented.},

	abstract = {Vertical wind shear and storm motion are two of the most important factors contributing to rainfall asymmetries in tropical cyclones (TCs). Global TC rainfall structure, in terms of azimuthal distribution and asymmetries relative to storm motion, has been previously described using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager rainfall estimates. The mean TC rainfall distribution and the wavenumber-1 asymmetry vary with storm intensity and geographical location among the six oceanic basins. This study uses a similar approach to investigate the relationship between the structure of TC rainfall and the environmental flow by computing the rainfall asymmetry relative to the vertical wind shear. The environmental vertical wind shear is defined as the difference between the mean wind vectors of the 200- and 850-hPa levels over an outer region extending from the radius of 200-800 km around the storm center. The wavenumber-1 maximum rainfall asymmetry is downshear left (right) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. The rainfall asymmetry decreases (increases) with storm intensity (shear strength). The rainfall asymmetry maximum is predominantly downshear left for shear values {\textgreater}7.5 m s(-1). Large asymmetries are usually observed away from the TC centers. As TC intensity increases, the asymmetry maximum shifts upwind to the left. The analysis is further extended to examine the storm motion and the vertical wind shear and their collective effects on TC rainfall asymmetries. It is found that the vertical wind shear is a dominant factor for the rainfall asymmetry when shear is {\textgreater}5 m s(-1). The storm motion-relative rainfall asymmetry in the outer rainband region is comparable to that of shear relative when the shear is {\textless}5 m s(-1), suggesting that TC translation speed becomes an important factor in the low shear environment. The overall TC rainfall asymmetry depends on the juxtaposition and relative magnitude of the storm motion and environmental shear vectors in all oceanic basins.},

A new scheme of diffusional growth allows the reproduction of in situ - measured droplet size distributions including those formed in extremely polluted air. It was shown that pyroclouds forming over the forest fires can precipitate. Several mechanisms leading to formation of precipitation from pyroclouds are considered.The mechanisms by which aerosols affect the microphysics and precipitation of warm cloud-base clouds have been investigated by analyzing the mass, heat, and moisture budgets. The increase in aerosol concentration increases both the generation and the loss of the condensate mass. In the clouds developing in dry air, the increase in the loss is dominant, which suggests a decrease in the accumulated precipitation with the aerosol concentration increase. On the contrary, an increase in aerosol concentration in deep maritime clouds leads to an increase in precipitation. The precipitation efficiency of clouds in polluted air is found to be several times lower than that of clouds forming in clean air. A classification of the results of aerosol effects on precipitation from clouds of different types developing in the atmosphere with high freezing level ( about 4 km) is proposed. The role of air humidity and other factors in precipitation's response to aerosols is discussed. The analysis shows that many discrepancies between the results reported in different observational and numerical studies can be attributed to the different atmospheric conditions and cloud types analyzed.},

Two aircraft cases with simultaneous Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer, Multispectral Atmospheric Mapping Sensor, and ER-2 Doppler radar measurements during the Convection and Moisture Experiment 3 in August 1998 are analyzed to investigate the influence of high thick cirrus clouds on two previously developed IR methods. In contrast, a microwave method based on the brightness temperature differences between the three water vapor channels around 183.3 GHz of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) (183.3 +/- 1, 183.3 +/- 3, and 183.3 +/- 7 GHz) can screen out high thick cirrus clouds efficiently. The tropical deep convective cloud fractions (30 degrees S-30 degrees N) estimated by the IR methods and the AMSU-B method are compared. Although their geographical distributions are in well agreement with each other, the total fractions detected by the IR methods are about 2-3.5 times greater than that detected by the AMSU-B method. Moreover, the overestimation of deep convective cloud fractions by the IR method (11-mu m brightness temperature less than 215 K) can result in a displacement in the detected location of the deep convective clouds. The average thick cirrus clouds cover 2.5 times the area of the deep convective clouds that generates them.},

	abstract = {During the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) project, the microphysical properties of over 1000 warm, nonprecipitating, clouds were measured from the University of Washington research aircraft. The clouds were partially embedded in the continental-scale, smoky haze that envelops much of Brazil during the biomass-burning season. For the entire data set, the most universal parameterization for the effective cloud droplet radius (r(eff)) is as a function of the ratio of cloud liquid water content (LWC) to droplet concentration (essentially the volume mean radius, r(v)); this agrees with previous studies under less polluted conditions. Comparisons of SCAR-B data with data from the east coast of the United States and clean oceanic areas show that the r(eff)-r(v) relationship is similar in all three cases, suggesting that even the extreme case of clouds impacted by large biomass fires can be treated similarly to more typical clouds. Beyond a certain ambient concentration of accumulation-mode particles (similar to 3000-4000 cm(-3)), cloud drop number concentrations for cumulus clouds in Brazil were almost constant, so that further increases in the ambient particle concentration did not change r(eff), and r(eff) correlates well with LWC alone. For example, a cumulus cloud, which capped a particularly large smoke plume with total particle concentrations {\textgreater}150,000 cm(-3), had the same r(eff)-LWC relationship as other clouds in the region where the ambient particle concentrations were similar to 3000 cm(-3). In this study the values of r(eff) for cumulus clouds in Brazil affected by smoke were between 3 and 8 mu m, compared to 9 to 14 mu m inferred from satellite measurements of cloud reflectivity at 3.7 mu m by Kaufman and Fraser [1997].},

It is found that only the window channel at 89 GHz has an apparent dependence on the surface emissivity. The three water vapor channels around 183 GHz (i.e., 183.3 +/- 1, +/- 3, and +/- 7 GHz) are completely independent, and the window channel at 150 GHz is nearly independent of the surface emissivity because of the atmospheric opacity at these frequencies. All channels are apparently influenced by deep convective clouds and their outflowing thick cirrus clouds. The channels at 89, 150, and 183.3 +/- 7 GHz are strongly sensitive to variations in the liquid water content at levels above 5 km. The sensitivity of the channel at 150 GHz to liquid water is about twice that at 183.3 +/- 7 GHz. All channels are generally sensitive to variations in the frozen hydrometeor content at levels above 7 km. The 183.3 +/- 1 GHz channel has virtually no influence from the frozen hydrometeors at levels below 7 km. The sensitivity suggests that it should be possible to estimate the frozen hydrometeor properties in levels above 7 km in tropical deep convective clouds using the water vapor channels around 183 GHz.},

On the basis of a straightforward geometrical analysis of Large Eddy Simulation results of shallow cumulus clouds, we conclude (1) that the upward mass transport by clouds is strongly dominated by regions close to the edge of clouds rather than by the core region of clouds and (2) that the downward mass transport is dominated by processes just outside the cloud. The latter finding contradicts the accepted view of a uniformly descending dry environment. We therefore advocate a refined view which distinguishes between the near-cloud environment and the distant environment. The near-cloud environment is characterized by coherent descending motions, whereas the distant environment is rather quiescent and plays no significant role in vertical transport.},

First, a detailed comparison between observational and numerical results is presented to better validate LES as a tool for studies of microscale phenomena. It is found that horizontal cloud profiles of vertical velocity, humidity, and temperature are in good agreement with observations. They show features similar to the observations, including the presence of the shell of descending air around the cloud. Second, the availability of the complete 3D dataset in LES has been exploited to examine the role of lateral mixing in the exchange of cloud and environmental air. The origin of the subsiding shell is examined by analyzing the individual terms of the vertical momentum equation. Buoyancy is found to be the driving force for this shell, and it is counteracted by the pressure-gradient force. This shows that evaporative cooling at the cloud edge, induced by lateral mixing of cloudy and environmental air, is the responsible mechanism behind the descending shell. For all clouds, and especially the smaller ones, the negative mass flux generated by the subsiding shell is significant. This suggests an important role for lateral mixing throughout the entire cloud layer. The role of the shell in these processes is further explored and described in a conceptual three-layer model of the cloud.},

The origin of in-cloud air is studied by two distinct methods: 1) by analyzing conserved variable mixing diagrams (Paluch diagrams) and 2) by tracing back cloud-air parcels represented by massless Lagrangian particles that follow the flow. The obtained Paluch diagrams are found to be similar to many results in the literature, but the source of entrained air found by particle tracking deviates from the source inferred from the Paluch analysis. Whereas the classical Paluch analysis seems to provide some evidence for cloud-top mixing, particle tracking shows that virtually all mixing occurs laterally. Particle trajectories averaged over the entire cloud ensemble also clearly indicate the absence of significant cloud-top mixing in shallow cumulus clouds.},

In recent years, thanks to improved satellite and in situ observations, and better models, great strides have been made in aerosol and monsoon research, respectively. There is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that interaction of aerosol forcing with monsoon dynamics may alter the redistribution of energy in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, thereby influencing monsoon water cycle and climate. In this article, the authors describe the scientific rationale and challenges for an integrated approach to study the interactions between aerosol and monsoon water cycle dynamics. A joint Aerosol-Monsoon Experiment (JAMEX) is proposed for 2007-11, with enhanced observations of the physical and chemical properties, sources and sinks, and long-range transport of aerosols, in conjunction with meteorological and oceanographic observations in the Indo-Pacific continental and oceanic regions. JAMEX will leverage on coordination among many ongoing and planned national research programs on aerosols and monsoons in China, India, Japan, Nepal, Italy, and the United States, as well as international research programs of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).},

	abstract = {Nitrogen oxides ( NOx = NO+ NO2) play an important role in tropospheric chemistry, in particular in catalytic ozone production. Lightning provides a natural source of nitrogen oxides, dominating the production in the tropical upper troposphere, with strong impact on tropospheric ozone and the atmosphere's oxidizing capacity. Recent estimates of lightning produced NOx (LNOx) are of the order of 5 Tg [N] per year with still high uncertainties in the range of one order of magnitude.The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on board the ESA-satellite ERS-2 allows the retrieval of tropospheric column densities of NO2 on a global scale. Here we present the GOME NO2 measurement directly over a large convective system over the Gulf of Mexico. Simultaneously, cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes are counted by the U. S. National Lightning Detection Network ( NLDN(TM)), and extrapolated to include intra-cloud (IC)+CG flashes based on a climatological IC: CG ratio derived from NASA's space-based lightning sensors. A series of 14 GOME pixels shows largely enhanced column densities over thick and high clouds, coinciding with strong lightning activity. The enhancements can not be explained by transport of anthropogenic NOx and must be due to fresh production of LNOx. A quantitative analysis, accounting in particular for the visibility of LNOx from satellite, yields a LNOx production of 90 ( 32 - 240) moles of NOx, or 1.3 ( 0.4 - 3.4) kg [ N], per flash. If simply extrapolated, this corresponds to a global LNOx production of 1.7 ( 0.6 - 4.7) Tg [N]/yr.},

	abstract = {[1] We quantify the processes controlling the tropical tropospheric ozone burden with particular attention to the tropical Atlantic, using a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) constrained by satellite and in situ observations of O-3, NO2, and HCHO. Lightning is the dominant contributor to tropical tropospheric O-3, accounting for more than 37\% of the O-3 burden over the Atlantic on annual average. The contributions from biomass burning, soils, and fossil fuels are 4 to 6 times smaller, despite comparable source strengths. This discrepancy can be explained by the tropical ozone production efficiency of lightning ( 32 mol/ mol), soils ( 14 mol/ mol), biomass burning ( 10 mol/ mol), and fossil fuel ( 13 mol/ mol) sources, as calculated using sensitivity simulations with a 1\% perturbation. The role of volatile organic compound emissions on the tropical Atlantic ozone burden is negligible ({\textless} 2.5\%). Stratosphere-troposphere exchange accounts for less than 5\% of the regional O-3 burden. The tropical Atlantic O-3 burden is more strongly influenced by nitrogen oxides from Africa ({\textgreater} 30\%) than from South America ({\textgreater} 18\%) or the eastern tropics ({\textgreater} 11\%). Lightning is responsible for more than 39\% of the atmospheric oxidation capacity, higher than other sources. The dominant sources of uncertainty in the tropical oxidation rate are the lightning magnitude and the cloud convective parameterization.},

	abstract = {Cumulus congestus clouds, with moderate shortwave albedos and cloud-top temperatures near freezing, occur fairly often in the Tropics. These clouds may play an important role in the evolution of the Madden-Julian oscillation and the regulation of relative humidity in the midtroposphere. Despite this importance they are not necessarily simulated very well in global climate models. Surface remote sensing observations and soundings from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) climate research facility at Nauru Island are coupled with a simple parcel model in order to address the following questions about these cloud types: 1) Which environmental factors play a role in determining the depth of tropical convective clouds? 2) What environmental parameters are related to entrainment rate in cumulus congestus clouds? The results presented herein suggest that at Nauru Island a drying of the midtroposphere is more likely to be responsible for limiting congestus cloud-top heights than is a stabilizing of the freezing level. It is also found that low-level CAPE and the RH profile account for the largest portion of the variance in cumulus congestus entrainment rates, consistent with the idea that entrainment rate depends on the buoyant production of turbulent kinetic energy. If the analysis is limited to cases where there is a sounding during the hour preceding the cumulus congestus observations, it is found that the low-level CAPE accounts for 85\% of the total variance in entrainment rate.},

This has been attributed to the effects of stationary weather systems set by elevated terrain (orography), and to a lack of maritime influences from the prevailing westerly winds. However, the differences in extent and orography between the two continents suggest that further mechanisms are involved. Here we show that this anomalous winter cold can result in part from westward radiation of large-scale atmospheric waves–nearly stationary Rossby waves–generated by heating of the atmosphere over warm ocean waters. We demonstrate this mechanism using simulations with an idealized general circulation model, with which we show that the extent of the cold region is controlled by properties of Rossby waves, such as their group velocity and its dependence on the planetary rotation rate. Our results show that warm ocean waters contribute to the contrast in mid-latitude winter temperatures between eastern and western continental boundaries not only by warming western boundaries, but also by cooling eastern boundaries.},

In particular, a substantially weakened AMOC leads to a southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. However, the simulated amplitudes of the AMOC-induced tropical climate change differ substantially among different models. In this paper, the sensitivity to cloud feedback of the climate response to a change in the AMOC is studied using a coupled ocean–atmosphere model [the GFDL Coupled Model, version 2.1 (CM2.1)]. Without cloud feedback, the simulated AMOC-induced climate change in this model is weakened substantially. Low-cloud feedback has a strong amplifying impact on the tropical ITCZ shift in this model, whereas the effects of high-cloud feedback are weaker. It is concluded that cloud feedback is an important contributor to the uncertainty in the global response to...},

Random errors appear to be due primarily to variations in cloud ice-water content (IWC). Radiative transfer calculations show that Delta Z corresponds to an optical depth of similar to 1, which based on observed ice-particle sizes yields an average cloud-top IWC of similar to 0.015 gm(-3), a value consistent with in situ measurements.

	abstract = {The thermodynamic structure on top of a numerically simulated severe storm is examined to explain the satellite observed plume formation above thunderstorm anvils. The same mechanism also explains the formation of jumping cirrus observed by Fujita on board of a research aircraft. A three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic cloud model is used to perform numerical simulation of a supercell that occurred in Montana in 1981. Analysis of the model results shows that both the plume and the jumping cirrus phenomena are produced by the high instability and breaking of the gravity waves excited by the strong convection inside the storm. These mechanisms dramatically enhance the turbulent diffusion process and cause some moisture to detach from the storm cloud and jump into the stratosphere. The thermodynamic structure in terms of the potential temperature isotherms above the simulated thunderstorm is examined to reveal the instability and wave breaking structure. The plumes and jumping cirrus phenomena represent an irreversible transport mechanism of materials from the troposphere to the stratosphere that may have global climatic implications.

	abstract = {Deep moist convection generates turbulence in the clear air above and around developing clouds, penetrating convective updrafts and mature thunderstorms. This turbulence can be due to shearing instabilities caused by strong flow deformations near the cloud top, and also to breaking gravity waves generated by cloud-environment interactions. Turbulence above and around deep convection is an important safety issue for aviation, and improved understanding of the conditions that lead to out-of-cloud turbulence formation may result in better turbulence avoidance guidelines or forecasting capabilities. In this study, a series of high-resolution two- and three-dimensional model simulations of a severe thunderstorm are conducted to examine the sensitivity of above-cloud turbulence to a variety of background flow conditions-in particular, the above-cloud wind shear and static stability. Shortly after the initial convective overshoot, the above-cloud turbulence and mixing are caused by local instabilities in the vicinity of the cloud interfacial boundary. At later times, when the convection is more mature, gravity wave breaking farther aloft dominates the turbulence generation. This wave breaking is caused by critical-level interactions, where the height of the critical level is controlled by the above-cloud wind shear. The strength of the above-cloud wind shear has a strong influence on the occurrence and intensity of above-cloud turbulence, with intermediate shears generating more extensive regions of turbulence, and strong shear conditions producing the most intense turbulence. Also, more stable above-cloud environments are less prone to turbulence than less stable situations. Among other things, these results highlight deficiencies in current turbulence avoidance guidelines in use by the aviation industry.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric brown clouds are mostly the result of biomass burning and fossil fuel consumption(1). They consist of a mixture of light-absorbing and light-scattering aerosols(1) and therefore contribute to atmospheric solar heating and surface cooling. The sum of the two climate forcing terms-the net aerosol forcing effect is thought to be negative and may have masked as much as half of the global warming attributed to the recent rapid rise in greenhouse gases(2). There is, however, at least a fourfold uncertainty(2) in the aerosol forcing effect. Atmospheric solar heating is a significant source of the uncertainty, because current estimates are largely derived from model studies. Here we use three lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles that were vertically stacked between 0.5 and 3 km over the polluted Indian Ocean. These unmanned aerial vehicles deployed miniaturized instruments measuring aerosol concentrations, soot amount and solar fluxes. During 18 flight missions the three unmanned aerial vehicles were flown with a horizontal separation of tens of metres or less and a temporal separation of less than ten seconds, which made it possible to measure the atmospheric solar heating rates directly. We found that atmospheric brown clouds enhanced lower atmospheric solar heating by about 50 per cent. Our general circulation model simulations, which take into account the recently observed widespread occurrence of vertically extended atmospheric brown clouds over the Indian Ocean and Asia(3), suggest that atmospheric brown clouds contribute as much as the recent increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases to regional lower atmospheric warming trends. We propose that the combined warming trend of 0.25 K per decade may be sufficient to account for the observed retreat of the Himalayan glaciers(4-6).},

	abstract = {Black carbon in soot is the dominant absorber of visible solar radiation in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic sources of black carbon, although distributed globally, are most concentrated in the tropics where solar irradiance is highest. Black carbon is often transported over long distances, mixing with other aerosols along the way. The aerosol mix can form transcontinental plumes of atmospheric brown clouds, with vertical extents of 3 to 5 km. Because of the combination of high absorption, a regional distribution roughly aligned with solar irradiance, and the capacity to form widespread atmospheric brown clouds in a mixture with other aerosols, emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions. In the Himalayan region, solar heating from black carbon at high elevations may be just as important as carbon dioxide in the melting of snowpacks and glaciers. The interception of solar radiation by atmospheric brown clouds leads to dimming at the Earth's surface with important implications for the hydrological cycle, and the deposition of black carbon darkens snow and ice surfaces, which can contribute to melting, in particular of Arctic sea ice.},

	abstract = {The cloud scanner sensor is a central part of a recently proposed satellite remote sensing concept - the three-dimensional (3-D) cloud and aerosol interaction mission (CLAIM-3D) combining measurements of aerosol characteristics in the vicinity of clouds and profiles of cloud microphysical characteristics. Such a set of collocated measurements will allow new insights in the complex field of cloud-aerosol interactions affecting directly the development of clouds and precipitation, especially in convection. The cloud scanner measures radiance reflected or emitted by cloud sides at several wavelengths to derive a profile of cloud particle size and thermodynamic phase. For the retrieval of effective size a Bayesian approach was adopted and introduced in a preceding paper.In this paper the potential of the approach, which has to account for the complex three-dimensional nature of cloud geometry and radiative transfer, is tested in realistic cloud observing situations. In a fully simulated environment realistic cloud resolving modelling provides complex 3-D structures of ice, water, and mixed phase clouds, from the early stage of convective development to mature deep convection. A three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer is used to realistically simulate the aspired observations.A large number of cloud data sets and related simulated observations provide the database for an experimental Bayesian retrieval. An independent simulation of an additional cloud field serves as a synthetic test bed for the demonstration of the capabilities of the developed retrieval techniques. For this test case only a minimal overall bias in the order of 1\% as well as pixel-based uncertainties in the order of 1 mu m for droplets and 8 mu m for ice particles were found for measurements at a high spatial resolution of 250 m.},

	abstract = {In-situ measurements in convective clouds (up to the freezing level) over the Amazon basin show that smoke from deforestation fires prevents clouds from precipitating until they acquire a vertical development of at least 4 km, compared to only 1-2 km in clean clouds. The average cloud depth required for the onset of warm rain increased by similar to 350 m for each additional 100 cloud condensation nuclei per cm(3) at a super-saturation of 0.5\% (CCN0.5\%). In polluted clouds, the diameter of modal liquid water content grows much slower with cloud depth (at least by a factor of similar to 2), due to the large number of droplets that compete for available water and to the suppressed coalescence processes. Contrary to what other studies have suggested, we did not observe this effect to reach saturation at 3000 or more accumulation mode particles per cm(3). The CCN0.5\% concentration was found to be a very good predictor for the cloud depth required for the onset of warm precipitation and other microphysical factors, leaving only a secondary role for the updraft velocities in determining the cloud drop size distributions.The effective radius of the cloud droplets (r(e)) was found to be a quite robust parameter for a given environment and cloud depth, showing only a small effect of partial droplet evaporation from the cloud's mixing with its drier environment. This supports one of the basic assumptions of satellite analysis of cloud microphysical processes: the ability to look at different cloud top heights in the same region and regard their r(e) as if they had been measured inside one well developed cloud. The dependence of r(e) on the adiabatic fraction decreased higher in the clouds, especially for cleaner conditions, and disappeared at r(e){\textgreater}=similar to 10 mu m. We propose that droplet coalescence, which is at its peak when warm rain is formed in the cloud at r(e)=similar to 10 mu m, continues to be significant during the cloud's mixing with the entrained air, cancelling out the decrease in r(e) due to evaporation.},

However, we find that there are no well-defined mu-Lambda, or associated relations between reflectivity (Z) and rain rate (R) or differential reflectivity for all storms or portions thereof. Rather, there is a general behavior such that A and b ( in the Z = AR(b) relation) and median volume drop diameter D-o all decrease from convective ( C) to stratiform ( S) to transition ( T) rains. The mu-Lambda correlation of the investigators in question appears to be limited to rainfall events which do not include convective rain; it is biased toward S and T rains. They miss the narrow ( large mu), large D-o DSDs of convective rain that are often found to have equilibrium spectra. The dependence of D-o on the strength of the updraft and the findings of others concerning the association with the physics, dynamics, and climate regime strongly suggests that it is necessary to characterize the physical and dynamic nature of the storms in order to select the appropriate remote sensing algorithms.},

	abstract = {The U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program operates millimeter-wavelength cloud radars in several climatologically distinct regions. The digital signal processors for these radars were recently upgraded and allow for enhancements in the operational parameters running on them. Recent evaluations of millimeter-wavelength cloud radar signal processing performance relative to the range of cloud dynamical and microphysical conditions encountered at the ARM Program sites have indicated that improvements are necessary, including significant improvement in temporal resolution (i. e., less than 1 s for dwell and 2 s for dwell and processing), wider Nyquist velocities, operational dealiasing of the recorded spectra, removal of pulse compression while sampling the boundary layer, and continuous recording of Doppler spectra. A new set of millimeter- wavelength cloud radar operational modes that incorporate these enhancements is presented. A significant change in radar sampling is the introduction of an uneven mode sequence with 50\% of the sampling time dedicated to the lower atmosphere, allowing for detailed characterization of boundary layer clouds. The changes in the operational modes have a substantial impact on the postprocessing algorithms that are used to extract cloud information from the radar data. New methods for postprocessing of recorded Doppler spectra are presented that result in more accurate identification of radar clutter (e. g., insects) and extraction of turbulence and microphysical information. Results of recent studies on the error characteristics of derived Doppler moments are included so that uncertainty estimates are now included with the moments. The microscale data product based on the increased temporal resolution of the millimeter- wavelength cloud radars is described. It contains the number of local maxima in each Doppler spectrum, the Doppler moments of the primary peak, uncertainty estimates for the Doppler moments of the primary peak, Doppler moment shape parameters (e. g., skewness and kurtosis), and clear- air clutter flags.},

	abstract = {It has long been known that trade wind cumulus and deep cumulonimbus represent primary components of the broad spectrum of cumulus clouds in the Tropics, which has led to the concept of a bimodal distribution of tropical clouds. However, recent analyses of shipboard radar data from Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) provide evidence of abundant populations of a third cloud type, cumulus congestus. Congestus clouds constitute over half the precipitating convective clouds in COARE and contribute over one-quarter of the total convective rainfall. Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment studies reveal a similar midlevel peak in the distribution of radar-echo tops. These findings lead to the conclusion that shallow cumulus, congestus, and cumulonimbus are all prominent tropical cumulus cloud types. They are associated with trimodal distributions of divergence, cloud detrainment, and fractional cloudiness in the Tropics.The peaks in the distributions of radar-echo tops for these three cloud types are in close proximity to prominent stable layers that exist over the Pacific warm pool and the tropical eastern Atlantic: near 2 km (the trade stable layer), similar to 5 km (near 0 degrees C). and similar to 15-16 km (the tropopause). These stable layers are inferred to inhibit cloud growth and promote cloud detrainment. The 0 degrees C stable layer can produce detrainment from cumulonimbi (attendant shelf clouds) and help retard the growth of precipitation-laden and strongly entraining congestus clouds. Moreover, restriction of growth of congest-us clouds to just above the 0 degrees C level limits further enhancement of cloud buoyancy through glaciation.The three cloud types are found to vary significantly during COARE on the timescale of the 30-60-day intraseasonal oscillation. The specific roles of clouds of the congestus variety in the general circulation are not yet clear, but some (the shallower ones) contribute to moistening and preconditioning the atmosphere for deep convection: others (the deeper ones) contribute an important fraction of the total tropical rainfall. and both likely produce many midlevel clouds, thereby modulating the radiative heating of the tropical atmosphere.},

The model includes unprecedented treatment of coupled smoke aerosol- cloud-radiative feedbacks in a 3- dimensional model that resolves scales of similar to 100s m. It is shown that the vertical distribution of smoke aerosol in the convective boundary layer is crucial to determining whether cloudiness is reduced; Smoke aerosol emitted at the surface in a daytime convective boundary layer may reduce or increase cloudiness whereas smoke aerosol residing in the layer where clouds tend to form will reduce cloudiness. On the other hand, the reduction in surface latent and sensible heat fluxes associated with biomass burning is sufficient by itself to substantially reduce cloudiness.},

The paper gives an introduction to aerosol-cloud processes involving CCN and IN in general and provides a short summary of previous laboratory, field and modelling work which investigated the CCN and IN activity of bacterial cells and pollen. Recent measurements of atmospheric ice nuclei with a continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) and of the heterogeneous ice nucleation efficiency of bacterial cells are also briefly discussed. As a main result of this overview paper we conclude that a proper assessment of the impact of biological particles on tropospheric clouds needs new laboratory, field and modelling work on the abundance of biological particles in the atmosphere and their CCN and heterogeneous IN properties.},

	abstract = {[1] We present a new large eddy simulation model that comprises coupled components representing size-resolved aerosol and cloud microphysics, radiative properties of aerosol and clouds, dynamics, and a surface soil and vegetation model. The model is used to investigate the effect of increases in aerosol on liquid water path LWP, cloud fraction, optical depth, and precipitation formation in warm, continental cumulus clouds. Sets of simulations that either neglect, or include the radiative properties of a partially absorbing aerosol are performed. In the absence of aerosol radiative effects, an increase in aerosol loading results in a reduction in precipitation. However, the clouds do not experience significant changes in LWP, cloud fraction and cloud depth; aerosol effects on LWP and cloud fraction are small compared to the dynamical variability of the clouds at any given aerosol concentration. Reasons for this response are discussed. When aerosol radiative effects are included, the modification in atmospheric heating profiles, and the reduction in surface latent and sensible heat fluxes resulting from the presence of these particles, have a significant effect on cloud parameters and boundary layer evolution. For the case considered, there is a significant reduction in the strength of convection, LWP, cloud fraction and cloud depth. Cloud optical depth responds non-monotonically to the increase in aerosol. These results indicate that in continental regions surface processes must be included in calculations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions. Neglect of these surface processes may result in an overestimate of the second aerosol indirect effect.},

Particular attention is given to the basic theoretical underpinnings of the subject, especially the interplay of particle diffusion, heat diffusion and surface attachment kinetics during crystal growth, as well as growth instabilities that have important effects on snow crystal development.The first part of this review focuses on understanding the dramatic variations seen in snow crystal morphology as a function of temperature, a mystery that has remained largely unsolved since its discovery 75 years ago. To this end we examine the growth of simple hexagonal ice prisms in considerable detail, comparing crystal growth theory with laboratory measurements of growth rates under a broad range of conditions. This turns out to be a surprisingly rich problem, which ultimately originates from the unusual molecular structure of the ice surface and its sensitive dependence on temperature. With new clues from precision measurements of attachment kinetics, we are now just beginning to understand these structural changes at the ice surface and how they affect the crystal growth process. We also touch upon the mostly unexplored topic of how dilute chemical impurities can greatly alter the growth of snow crystals.The second part of this review examines pattern formation in snow crystals, with special emphasis on the growth of snow crystal dendrites. Again we treat this as a case study of the more general problem of dendritic growth during diffusion-limited solidification. Since snow crystals grow from the vapour, we can apply dendrite theory in the simplified slow-growth limit where attachment kinetics dominates over capillarity in selecting the tip velocity. Although faceting is quite pronounced in these structures, many aspects of the formation of snow crystal dendrites are fairly well described using a theoretical treatment that does not explicitly incorporate faceting. We also describe electrically modified ice dendrite growth, which produces some novel needle-like structures.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms through which atmospheric aerosols affect cloud microphysics, dynamics and precipitation are investigated using a spectral microphysics two-dimensional cloud model. A significant effect of aerosols on cloud microphysics and dynamics has been found. Maritime aerosols lead to a rapid formation of raindrops that fall down through cloud updraughts increasing the loading in the lower part of a cloud. This is, supposedly, one of the reasons for comparatively low updraughts in maritime convective clouds. An increase in the concentration of small cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) leads to the formation of a large number of small droplets with a low collision rate, resulting in a time delay of raindrop formation. Such a delay prevents a decrease in the vertical velocity caused by the falling raindrops and thus increases the duration of the diffusion droplet growth stage, increasing latent heat release by condensation. The additional water that rises to the freezing level increases latent heat release by freezing. As a result, clouds developing in continental-type aerosol tend to have larger vertical velocities and to attain higher levels.The results show that a decrease in precipitation efficiency of single cumulus clouds arising in microphysically continental air is attributable to a greater loss of the precipitating mass due to a greater sublimation of ice and evaporation of drops while they are falling from higher levels through a deep layer of dry air outside cloud updraughts. By affecting precipitation, atmospheric aerosols influence the net heating of the atmosphere. Simulations show that aerosols also change the vertical distribution of latent heat release, increasing the level of the heating peak.Clouds arising under continental aerosol conditions produce as a rule stronger downdraughts and stronger convergence in the boundary layer. Being triggered by larger dynamical forcing, secondary clouds arising in microphysically continental air are stronger and can, according to the results of simulations, form a squall line. The squall line formation was simulated both under maritime (GATE-74) and continental (PRE-STORM) thermodynamic conditions. In the maritime aerosol cases, clouds developing under similar thermodynamic conditions do not produce strong downdraughts and do not lead to squall line formation.Thus, the 'aerosol effect' on precipitation can be understood only in combination with the 'dynamical effect' of aerosols. Simulations allow us to suggest that aerosols, which decrease the precipitation efficiency of most single clouds, can contribute to the formation of very intensive convective clouds and thunderstorms (e.g. squall lines, etc.) accompanied by very high precipitation rates. Affecting precipitation, net atmospheric heating and its vertical distribution, as well as cloud depth and cloud coverage, atmospheric aerosols (including anthropogenic ones) influence atmospheric motions and radiation balance at different scales, from convective to, possibly, global ones.},

	abstract = {A toy model of large-scale deep convection variations is constructed around a radiative-convective equilibrium climate, with an observed mean sounding as its thermodynamic basic state. Vertical structure is truncated at two modes, excited by convective (one-signed) and stratiform (two-signed) beating processes in tropical deep convection. Separate treatments of deep and shallow convection ale justified by observations that deep convection is more variable. Deep convection intensity is assumed to be modulated by convective available potential energy (CAPE), while occurence frequency is modulated by the ratio of convective inhibition (CIN) to "triggering energy" It: a scalar representing the intensity of subgrid-scale fluctuations. Deep convective downdrafts cool and dry the boundary layer but also increase K. Variations of Ii make the relationship between convection and thermodynamic variables (CAPE, GIN, theta(e)) nonunique and amplify the deep convective response to temperature waves of small (similar to 1 degrees C) amplitude.For a parameter set in which CAPE varions control convection, moist convective damping destroys all variability. When CIN/K variations have dominant importance (the "inhibition-controlled" regime), a mechanism termed "stratiform instability" generates large-scale waves. This mechanism involves lower tropospheric cooling by stratiform precipitation, which preferentially occurs where the already cool lower troposphere favors deep convection, via smaller CIM. Stratiform instability has two subregimes, based on the relative importance of the two opposite effects of downdrafts: When boundary layer theta(e), reduction (a local negative feedback) is stronger, small-scale waves with frequency based on the boundary layer recovery time are preferred. When the K-generation effect (positive feedback) is stronger, very large scales (low wavenumbers of the domain) develop. A mixture of these scales occurs for parameter choices based on observations. Model waves resemble observed waves, with a phase speed similar to 20 m s(-1) (near the dry wave speed of the second internal mode), and a "cold boomerang vertical temperatures structure.Although ii exhibits "quasi-equilibrium” with other convection variables (correlations {\textgreater} 0.99), replacing the prognostic K equation with diagnostic equations based on these relationships can put the model into wildly different regimes, if small time lags indicative of causality are distorted. The response of model convection to climatological spatial anomalies of theta(e), (proxy For SST) and K (proxy For orographic and coastal triggering) is considered. Higher SST tends broadly to favor convection under either CAPE-controlled or inhibition-controlled regimes, but there: are dynamical embellishments in the inhibition-controlled regime. The Kelvin wave seems to be the preferred structure when the model is run on a uniform equatorial beta plane.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a critical review of the topic of cloud-climate feedbacks and exposes some of the underlying reasons for the inherent lack of understanding of these feedbacks and why progress might he expected on this important climate problem in the coming decade. Although many processes and related parameters come under the influence of clouds, it is argued that atmospheric processes fundamentally govern the cloud feedbacks via the relationship between he atmospheric circulations, cloudiness, and the radiative and latent heating of the atmosphere. It is also shown how perturbations to the atmospheric radiation budget that are induced by cloud changes in response to climate forcing dictate the eventual response of the global-mean hydrological cycle of the climate model to climate forcing. This suggests that cloud feedbacks are likely to control the bulk precipitation efficiency and associated responses of the planet's hydrological cycle to climate radiative forcings.The paper provides a brief overview of the effects of clouds on the radiation budget of the earth-atmosphere system and a review of cloud feedbacks as they have been defined in simple systems, one being a system in radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) and others relating to simple feedback ideas that regulate tropical SSTs. The systems perspective is reviewed as it has served as the basis for most feedback analyses. What emerges is the importance of being clear about the definition of the system. It is shown how different assumptions about the system produce very different conclusions about the magnitude and sign of feedbacks. Much more diligence is called for in terms of defining the system and justifying assumptions. In principle, there is also neither any theoretical basis to justify the system that defines feedbacks in terms of global-time-mean changes in surface temperature nor is there any compelling empirical evidence to do so. The lack of maturity of feedback analysis methods also suggests that progress ill understanding climate feedback will require development of alternative methods of analysis.It has been argued that, in view of the complex nature of the climate system, and the cumbersome problems encountered in diagnosing feedbacks, understanding cloud feedback will be gleaned neither from observations nor proved from simple theoretical argument alone. The blueprint for progress must follow a more arduous path that requires a carefully orchestrated and systematic combination of model and observations. Models provide the tool for diagnosing processes anal quantifying feedbacks while observations provide the essential test of the model's credibility in representing these processes. While GCM climate and NWP models represent the most complete description of all the interactions between the processes that presumably establish the main cloud feedbacks. the weak link in the use of these models lies in the cloud parameterization imbedded in them. Aspects of these parameterizations remain worrisome, containing levels of empiricism and assumptions that are hard to evaluate with current global observations. Clearly observationally based methods for evaluating cloud parameterizations are all important element in the road map to progress.Although progress in understanding the cloud feedback problem has been slow and confused by past analysis, there are legitimate reasons outlined in the paper that give hope for real progress in the future.},

	abstract = {The A-Train satellite constellation has dramatically increased the temporal and spatial coverage of atmospheric ice water content estimates. The new data are derived by retrieval algorithms designed to estimate atmospheric cloud ice water content from remotely sensed measurements. Such retrieval algorithms rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the characteristics of ice particles in the atmosphere. In this study, the sensitivities of CloudSat ice water content retrievals to frozen particle characteristics are tested by generating CloudSat-like retrievals from profiles of known ice water content. CloudSat actively measures vertical profiles of radar reflectivity in clouds with a 94-GHz cloud-profiling radar. Ice water content is retrieved in each cloudy profile at temperatures below 0 degrees C. To assess the CloudSat radar-only ice water content retrieval algorithm (version 5.0 in Release 3 [R03] and version 5.1 in Release 4 [R04] of 2B-CWC-RO), we apply a 94-GHz reflectivity simulator to profiles of ice water content generated by a cloud-resolving numerical model and comprising various frozen particle species (ice, snow, and graupel). The CloudSat ice water content retrieval algorithm is applied to the profiles of simulated reflectivity, and the results are compared to the modeled profiles of known frozen water mass. The results from each version of the algorithm are shown to be sensitive to the characteristics of the frozen particle size distributions and particle densities. Tests of version 5.0 indicate that height varying information could improve retrievals. Despite the addition of a height varying component implemented in version 5.1, similar positive biases are indicated in the tests of each algorithm.},

	abstract = {[ 1] Biomass burning in the Amazon provides strong input of aerosols into the atmosphere, with potential effects on precipitation, cloud properties, and radiative balance. However, few studies to date have systematically examined these effects at the scale of the Amazon Basin, over an entire burning season, using available data sets. We empirically study the relationships of aerosol optical depth (tau(a)) versus rainfall and cloud properties measured from satellites over the entire Brazilian Amazon during the dry, biomass burning seasons ( August - October) of 2000 and 2003. Elevated tau(a) was associated with increased rainfall in both 2000 and 2003. With enhanced tau(a), cloud cover increased significantly, and cloud top temperature/pressure decreased, suggesting higher cloud tops. The cloud droplet effective radius (R-e) exhibited minimal growth with cloud height under background levels of tau(a), while distinct increases in R-e at cloud top temperatures below - 10 degrees C, indicative of ice formation, were observed with aerosol loading. Although empirical correlations do not unequivocally establish the causal link from aerosols, these results are consistent with previous observational and modeling studies that pointed to dynamical effects from aerosols that invigorate convection, leading to higher clouds, enhanced cloud cover, and stronger rainfall. We speculate that changes in precipitation and cloud properties associated with aerosol loading observed in this study could have important radiative and hydrological effects on the Amazonian climate system. The accelerated forest burning for agricultural land clearing and the resulting enhancements in aerosols and rainfall may even partially account for the observed positive trend in Amazonian precipitation over the past several decades.},

	abstract = {[1]The influences of the aerosol type and concentration and relative humidity ( RH) on cumulus clouds have been investigated using a two-dimensional spectral-bin cloud model. Three simulations are conducted to represent the polluted continental, clean continental, and marine aerosol types. Under the same initial dynamic and thermodynamic conditions, the maritime aerosol case results in more intensive radar reflectivity in both developing and mature stages than the continental aerosol cases, because of enhanced warm rain by collisions and ice processes by deposition growth due to larger droplet sizes and higher supersaturation, respectively. The considerable delay in convective development due to reduced droplet condensation is responsible for the longer cloud lifetime in the marine aerosol case. For the continental case, the most noticeable effects of increasing aerosol number concentrations ( with 15 different initial values) are the increases of the cloud droplet number concentration and cloud water content but a decrease in the effective droplet radius. More latent heat release from increasing condensation results in stronger convection and more melting precipitation at the higher aerosol concentrations. Melting precipitation and secondary clouds primarily contribute to enhanced precipitation with increasing aerosols. The precipitation, however, decreases with increasing aerosol in the extremely high aerosol cases ( over 5 x 10(4) cm(-3)) due to suppression of convection from depleted water vapor and inefficient coalescence. When the initial aerosol concentration exceeds a critical level, most of the cloud properties become less sensitive to aerosols, implying that the aerosol effect on deep convection is more pronounced in relatively clean air than in heavily polluted air. The aerosol effect on the cloud properties is strongly dependent on RH. As the surface RH increases from 40 to 70\%, the cloud changes from shallow warm to deep convective types due to a significant increase of convective available potential energy ( CAPE). The aerosol effects on the cloud microphysical properties and precipitation are negligible in dry air ( 40\% surface RH), but much more significant in humid air ( 60-70\% surface RH). The rain delay is sensitive to RH, but not to aerosols under similar initial thermodynamic conditions.},

Simulations with a cloud-resolving weather research and forecast model reveal that the increased deep convective clouds are reproduced when accounting for the aerosol effect from the Asian pollution outflow, which leads to large-scale enhanced convection and precipitation and hence an intensifed storm track over the Pacific. We suggest that the wintertime Pacific is highly vulnerable to the aerosol-cloud interaction because of favorable cloud dynamical and microphysical conditions from the coupling between the Pacific storm track and Asian pollution outflow. The intensified Pacific storm track is climatically significant and represents possibly the first detected climate signal of the aerosol-cloud interaction associated with anthropogenic pollution. In addition to radiative forcing on climate, intensification of the Pacific storm track likely impacts the global general circulation due to its fundamental role in meridional heat transport and forcing of stationary waves.},

To investigate the impacts of enhanced aerosol concentrations on the characteristics of convective storms and their subsequent anvil development, sensitivity tests are conducted using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) model, in which the initialization profiles of CCN, GCCN, and IFN concentrations are varied. These variations are found to have significant effects on the storm dynamics and microphysical processes, as well as on the surface precipitation. Updrafts are consistently stronger as the aerosol concentrations are increased. The anvils cover a smaller area but are better organized and have larger condensate mixing ratio maxima in the cases with greater aerosol concentrations. Cloud water mass tends to increase with increasing aerosol concentrations, with enhanced GCCN concentrations having the most significant influence. Increasing either the GCCN or IFN concentrations produces the most rainfall at the surface whereas enhanced CCN concentrations reduce surface rainfall. Higher IFN concentrations produce ice at warmer temperatures and deeper anvils, but simultaneously increasing the concentrations of CCN and GCCN leads to more supercooled liquid water available for freezing and greater ice mixing ratios. Graupel mixing ratios decrease and hail mixing ratios increase with increasing aerosol concentrations. Higher concentrations of GCCN and IFN result in greater accumulated surface precipitation initially. By the end of the simulation period, however, the accumulated precipitation is the greatest for the case in which the aerosol concentrations are lowest. Such changes in the dynamical and microphysical characteristics of convective storms as a result of the variations in aerosol concentrations have potential climate consequences, both through cloud radiative effects and the hydrological cycle. The impacts of varying CCN, GCCN, and IFN concentrations on the anvils will be discussed more fully in Part II.},

The radiative forcings of modeled cloud are found to generally increase with CCN0. This increase with CCN0 is more closely correlated to the changes in cloud coverage rather than other cloud properties. The enhanced convective strength of the modeled cloud with CCN0 affects the redistributions of chemical species including aerosols and water vapor. These impacts include an enhanced moistening of cloudy air while drying outside, an increase in the abundance of slowly soluble gases such as CO in the upper troposphere, and a simultaneous low availability of soluble gases attributed to the enhanced scavenging by cloud droplets. Additionally, the heterogeneous uptake of chemical species by ice particles is found to largely relate to the origins of these species and this uptake is also influenced by the changes in CCN0. Although the impacts of cloud on photochemistry are significant, these impacts appear to be not very sensitive to the changes in CCN0, caused primarily by the thick cloud layer in the modeled case.},

	abstract = {[1] The responses of cloud physical processes of a developing tropical deep convection to the increase of CCN concentration have been studied using a three-dimensional cloud-resolving model. Three sets of model simulations, each consisting of 30 runs initialized using a set of 30 different CCN profiles with maximum concentrations ranging from 50 to 6000/cm(3), have been carried out. The finding of this study that cloud droplet number concentration increases while cloud droplet size decreases with aerosol concentration is similar to the previous results mainly revealed in studies of stratiform clouds. However, the responses to increasing aerosol concentration of many other cloud properties illustrated in this study, particularly precipitation, are very different from those found or suggested in studies of stratiform clouds. Increasing CCN concentration causes a stronger convection, added mass of condensed water, and enhanced microphysical conversions, all leading to the increase in precipitation as well as the expansion of the cloud coverage. Interestingly, when initial CCN concentration exceeds a certain level, many of the above effects become insignificant, suggesting a relationship between some cloud properties and the logarithm of CCN concentration and further implying that a more substantial aerosol effect on deep convection could be seen over a clean rather than polluted region. Overall speaking, increasing CCN concentration does not significantly affect the precipitation efficiency. The increase with CCN concentration of upward flux of water vapor entering the cloud thus leads to an enhancement in moistening the free troposphere brought by the modeled cloud, besides adding more precipitation to the ground.},

	abstract = {Different definitions of storm precipitation efficiency were investigated from numerical simulations of convective systems in widely varying ambient conditions using a two-dimensional cloud model with sophisticated ice microphysics. The model results indicate that the vertical orientation of the updrafts, which is controlled by the vertical wind shear, and the ambient moisture content are important in determining storm efficiency.In terms of rainfall divided by condensation, simulated efficiencies ranged from 20\%-35\% for convective systems that tilted strongly against the low-level shear (upshear), to 30\%-50\% for erect storms. Changes in environmental moisture produced smaller Variations in efficiency that were less than 10\%. Upright convection allows for effective collection of cloud condensate by precipitation, whereas lower efficiencies in upshear storms are due to greater evaporation of cloud at middle levels and evaporation of rain at lower levels. Development of trailing stratiform precipitation is promoted by the rearward transport of moisture and condensate in upshear-tilted updrafts with evaporation moistening the ambient air as it passes through the convection. The fraction of rainfall from stratiform processes increases with upshear tilt of the convection and is inefficient. Rainfall from convection tilting downshear is efficient in terms of the total condensation, but is inefficient in terms of the flux of vapor into the storm because the gust fronts are too weak to completely block the low-level inflow.Different closure assumptions in cumulus parameterization schemes that use functional relationships for precipitation efficiency were evaluated. None of them showed consistent agreement with the efficiency parameters diagnosed from the simulations. Detailed diagnostics over various temporal and spatial scales indicate that storm efficiency determined by total condensation varied much less than that obtained from moisture convergence. The former definition should be more useful in cumulus parameterizations. Spatial variations in moisture convergence were dominated by changes in net condensation within the area of the storm, while variability at larger scales resulted from the advection of dry air in downdraft wakes.},

In order to explore the sensitivity of squall lines to these environmental profiles, we have performed an extensive set of numerical simulations under various shear and moisture conditions in midlatitude-continental and tropical-oceanic temperature environments. From the results of the sensitivity simulations and the analyses of the environmental parameters, it is found that the static stability in a convectively unstable layer is of primary importance in determining the strength of squall lines. Under temperature environments having the same static stability, convective available potential energy (CAPE) and precipitable water content (PWC) well describe the squall-line intensity. Vertical shear also plays an important role in determining the squall-line structure as well as the intensity through the interaction with surface cold pool. The combination of the static stability in a convectively unstable layer, CAPE, and PWC should be examined in diagnosing the intensity of squall lines that develop with an optimal shear for their environment.

	abstract = {Severe convective storms are typically simulated using either an idealized, horizontally homogeneous environment (i.e., single sounding) or an inhomogeneous environment constructed using numerous types of observations. Representing opposite ends of the spectrum, the former allows for the study of storm dynamics without the complicating effects of either land surface or atmospheric variability, though arguably at the expense of physical realism, while the latter is especially useful for prediction and data sensitivity studies, though because of its physical completeness, determination of cause can be extremely difficult. In this study, the gap between these two extremes is bridged by specifying horizontal variations in environmental vertical shear in an idealized, controlled manner so that their influence on storm morphology can be readily diagnosed. Simulations are performed using the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), though with significant modification to accommodate the analytically specified environmental fields. Several steady-state environments are constructed herein that retain a good degree of physical realism while permitting clear interpretation of cause and effect. These experiments are compared to counterpart control simulations in homogeneous environments constructed using single wind profiles from selected locations within the inhomogeneous environment domain. Simulations in which steady-state vertical shear varies spatially are presented for different shear regimes (storm types). A gradient of weak shear across the storm system leads to preferred cell development on the flank with greater shear. In a stronger shear regime (i.e., in the borderline multicell/supercell regime), however, cell development is enhanced on the weaker shear flank while cell organization is enhanced on the strong shear side. When an entire storm system moves from weak to strong shear, changes in cell structure are influenced by local mesoscale forcing associated with the cold pool. In this particular experiment, cells near the leading edge of the cold pool, where gust front convergence occurs along a continuous line, evolve into a bow-echo structure as the shear increases. In contrast, simulated cells that remain relatively isolated on the flank of the cold pool tend to develop supercellular characteristics.},

	abstract = {Climate modes of variability over the Atlantic and Pacific may be amplified by a positive feedback between sea-surface temperature (SST) and marine boundary layer clouds. However, it is well known that climate models poorly simulate this feedback. Does this deficiency contribute to model-to-model differences in the representation of climate modes of variability? Over both the North Atlantic and Pacific, typical summertime interannual to interdecadal SST variability exhibits horseshoe-like patterns of co-located anomalies of shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE), low-level cloud fraction, SST, and estimated inversion strength over the subtropics and midlatitudes that are consistent with a positive cloud feedback. During winter over the midlatitudes, this feedback appears to be diminished. Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 that simulate a weak feedback between subtropical SST and shortwave CRE produce smaller and less realistic amplitudes of summertime SST and CRE variability over the northern oceans compared to models with a stronger feedback. The change in SST amplitude per unit change in CRE amplitude among the models and observations may be understood as the temperature response of the ocean mixed layer to a unit change in radiative flux over the course of a season. These results highlight the importance of boundary layer clouds in interannual to interdecadal atmosphere–ocean variability over the northern oceans during summer. The results also suggest that deficiencies in the simulation of these clouds in coupled climate models contribute to underestimation in their simulation of summer-to-summer SST variability.},

	abstract = {Precipitation suppression due to an increase of aerosol number concentration in stratiform cloud is well-known. It is not certain whether the suppression applies for deep convection. Recent studies have suggested increasing precipitation from deep convection with increasing aerosols under some, but not all, conditions. Increasing precipitation with increasing aerosols can result from strong interactions in deep convection between dynamics and microphysics. High cloud liquid, due to delayed autoconversion, provides more evaporation, leading to more active downdrafts, convergence fields, condensation, collection of cloud liquid by precipitable hydrometeors, and precipitation. Evaporation of cloud liquid is a primary determinant of the intensity of the interactions. It is partly controlled by wind shear modulating the entrainment of dry air into clouds and transport of cloud liquid into unsaturated areas. Downdraft-induced convergence, crucial to the interaction, is weak for shallow clouds, generally associated with low convective available potential energy ( CAPE). Aerosol effects on cloud and precipitation can vary with CAPE and wind shear. Pairs of idealized numerical experiments for high and low aerosol cases were run for five different environmental conditions to investigate the dependence of aerosol effect on stability and wind shear. In the environment of high CAPE and strong wind shear, cumulonimbus- and cumulus-type clouds were dominant. Transport of cloud liquid to unsaturated areas was larger at high aerosol, leading to stronger downdrafts. Because of the large vertical extent of those clouds, strong downdrafts and convergence developed for strong interactions between dynamics and microphysics. These led to larger precipitation at high aerosol. Detrainment of cloud liquid and associated evaporation were less with lower CAPE and wind shear, where dynamically weaker clouds dominated. Transport of cloud liquid to unsaturated areas was not as active as in the environment of high CAPE and strong shear. Also, evaporatively driven differences in downdrafts at their level of initial descent were not magnified in clouds with shallow depth as much as in deep convective clouds as they accelerated to the surface over shorter distances. Hence the interaction between dynamics and microphysics was reduced, leading to precipitation suppression at high aerosol. These results demonstrate that increasing aerosol can either decrease or increase precipitation for an imposed large-scale environment supporting cloud development. The implications for larger-scale aspects of the hydrological cycle will require further study with larger-domain models and cumulus parameterizations with advanced microphysics.},

Previous studies of the TTL radiative balance have focused on using radiosonde data, but remote sensing measurements from polar-orbiting satellites may provide the relevant horizontal and vertical information for assessing TTL solar heating and infrared cooling rates, especially across the Pacific Ocean. CloudSat provides a considerable amount of vertical information about the distribution of cloud properties relevant to heating rate analysis. The ability of CloudSat measurements and ancillary information to constrain LZH is explored. We employ formal error propagation analysis for derived heating rate uncertainty given the CloudSat cloud property retrieval algorithms. Estimation of the LZH to within approximately 0.5 to 1 km is achievable with CloudSat, but it has a low-altitude bias because the radar is unable to detect thin cirrus. This can be remedied with the proper utilization of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) lidar backscatter information. By utilizing an orbital simulation with the GISS data set, we explore the representativeness of non-cross-track scanning active sounders in terms of describing the LZH distribution. In order to supplement CloudSat, we explore the ability of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) to constrain LZH and find that these passive sounders are useful where the cloud top height does not exceed 7 km. The spatiotemporal distributions of LZH derived from CloudSat and CALIPSO measurements are presented which suggest that thin cirrus have a limited effect on LZH mean values but affect LZH variability.},

	abstract = {Satellite-borne and ground-based devices for the detection of lightning offer the opportunity to explore relationships-on all significant scales up to global-between lightning frequency,f, and other thundercloud parameters. Calculations predict that f is proportional to the product of the downflux p of solid precipitation and the upward mass flux, I, of ice crystals. This prediction has received support from limited computational studies. The physical reasons for such a relationship are explained in terms of the paramount role of ice in the electrification of thunderstorms. Herein, this prediction is subjected to further, preliminary examination through analysis of lightning and dual-polarimetric radar data collected during the STERAO experiment conducted in Northern Colorado during the summer of 1996. The analysis has yielded sonic highly provisional support for this flux hypothesis. Computed trends of radar derived hydrometeor fractions of solid precipitation and small ice show correlation to the total lightning frequency and raise the possibility of determining values of p and/or I from lightning measurements.It is shown that the extent to which the observed correlations between f and both solid precipitation and small ice trends are or are not strong can provide an indication as to whether the lightning activity is limited by the available concentrations of precipitating or non-precipitating ice in the upper regions of the charging zone of the thundercloud, where most of the charge transfer occurs. It is demonstrated that the most accurate determinations of precipitation rate p from measurements of lighting frequency f are likely to be for conditions where the field-growth is limited by the availability of graupel pellets. It is shown that the simultaneous time variations off and solid precipitation trends of the type obtained in the STERAO experiment could enable us to determine the nature of the dominant glaciation process operative in the thunderclouds studied.

Since multiple studies indicate that D-e is reduced by atmospheric aerosol, this relationship strengthens previous suggestions of a role for aerosols as well as dynamics in electrification. Moreover, the angular distribution of backscattered radiance shows that modest (similar to 10\%) D-e decreases reflect large (similar to 2x) increases in the number of small ({\textless} similar to 30 mu m) particles N, a finding supported by cloud model simulations.

	abstract = {While humans easily recognize relations between data from different domains without any supervision, learning to automatically discover them is in general very challenging and needs many ground-truth pairs that illustrate the relations. To avoid costly pairing, we address the task of discovering cross-domain relations given unpaired data. We propose a method based on generative adversarial networks that learns to discover relations between different domains (DiscoGAN). Using the discovered relations, our proposed network successfully transfers style from one domain to another while preserving key attributes such as orientation and face identity.

	abstract = {Pileus clouds form where humid, vertically stratified air is mechanically displaced ahead of rising convection. This paper describes convective formation of pileus cloud in the tropopause transition layer (TTL), and explores a possible link to the formation of long-lasting cirrus at cold temperatures. The study examines in detail in-situ measurements from off the coast of Honduras during the July 2002 CRYSTAL-FACE experiment that showed an example of TTL cirrus associated with, and penetrated by, deep convection. The TTL cirrus was enriched with total water compared to its surroundings, but was composed of extremely small ice crystals with effective radii between 2 and 4 mu m. Through gravity wave analysis, and intercomparison of measured and simulated cloud microphysics, it is argued that the TTL cirrus originated neither from convectively-forced gravity wave motions nor environmental mixing alone. Rather, it is hypothesized that a combination of these two processes was involved in which, first, a pulse of convection forced pileus cloud to form from TTL air; second, the pileus layer was punctured by the convective pulse and received larger ice crystals through interfacial mixing; third, the addition of this condensate inhibited evaporation of the original pileus ice crystals where a convectively forced gravity wave entered its warm phase; fourth, through successive pulses of convection, a sheet of TTL cirrus formed. While the general incidence and longevity of pileus cloud remains unknown, in-situ measurements, and satellite-based Microwave Limb Sounder retrievals, suggest that much of the tropical TTL is sufficiently humid to be susceptible to its formation. Where these clouds form and persist, there is potential for an irreversible repartition from water vapor to ice at cold temperatures.},

Supercooled water is a metastable state and, therefore, the associated phase transition must be irreversible. Temperature- dependent heat capacities of supercooled water and ice are used to calculate the entropy difference. That difference is then used to establish a lower bound on the amount of latent heat that can be liberated by the freezing droplets. The calculation is compared with tabulated values of the latent heat of fusion with surprising results. Based on a novel physical picture of the freezing process, the authors suggest a simple estimate for the effective latent heat that is suitable for heat budget calculations of glaciating clouds. In addition, the authors arrive at a quadratic dependence on supercooling, (Delta T)(2), for the irreversible contribution to heat exchange during the freezing process. The proportionality factor is estimated as -0.3 J mol(-1) K-2.},

Besides testing our ability to model conditional, highly dimensional distributions, text to image synthesis has many exciting and practical applications such as photo editing or computer-aided content creation. Recent progress has been made using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This material starts with a gentle introduction to these topics and discusses the existent state of the art models. Moreover, I propose Wasserstein GAN-CLS, a new model for conditional image generation based on the Wasserstein distance which offers guarantees of stability. Then, I show how the novel loss function of Wasserstein GAN-CLS can be used in a Conditional Progressive Growing GAN. In combination with the proposed loss, the model boosts by 7.07\% the best Inception Score (on the Caltech birds dataset) of the models which use only the sentence-level visual semantics. The only model which performs better than the Conditional Wasserstein Progressive Growing GAN is the recently proposed AttnGAN which uses word-level visual semantics as well.},

The conventional lapse-rate definition of the tropopause appears to have little physical relevance in the tropics, although it is easy to use operationally. A four year 'climatology' of the tropical tropopause from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses is presented. The zonal mean picture shows the annual cycle in properties that has been related to the extratropical stratospheric wave pump. However, there are large and important zonal asymmetries. These include a relatively low pressure and temperature at the tropopause near the west Pacific heating region during December-January-February, and a striking region with low pressure on the tropopause over India during June-July-August. Results from a baroclinic model with imposed diabatic heating are used to support the hypothesis that both these features can be attributed to the direct response of the atmosphere to a large-scale region of tropospheric diabatic heating. It is proposed that the stratospheric pump provides the general picture for the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere region, but that tropospheric convection is crucial in determining the important zonal asymmetries in this region.},

We demonstrate that this can effectively address the burstiness issue and improve retrieval accuracy.

Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Frechet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset.

	abstract = {We propose a novel approach for instance-level image retrieval. It produces a global and compact fixed-length representation for each image by aggregating many region-wise descriptors. In contrast to previous works employing pre-trained deep networks as a black box to produce features, our method leverages a deep architecture trained for the specific task of image retrieval. Our contribution is twofold: (i) we leverage a ranking framework to learn convolution and projection weights that are used to build the region features; and (ii) we employ a region proposal network to learn which regions should be pooled to form the final global descriptor. We show that using clean training data is key to the success of our approach. To that aim, we use a large scale but noisy landmark dataset and develop an automatic cleaning approach. The proposed architecture produces a global image representation in a single forward pass. Our approach significantly outperforms previous approaches based on global descriptors on standard datasets. It even surpasses most prior works based on costly local descriptor indexing and spatial verification. Additional material is available at www.xrce.xerox.com/Deep-Image-Retrieval.},

	abstract = {Convective clouds in the Tropics that penetrate the boundary layer inversion preferentially detrain into a shallow outflow layer (2-5 km) or a deep outflow layer (10-17 km). The properties of these layers are diagnosed from a one-dimensional model of the Tropics constrained by observed mean temperature and water vapor profiles. The mass flux divergence of the shallow cumuli (2-5 km) is balanced by a mass flux convergence of evaporatively forced descent (downdrafts), while the mass flux divergence of deep cumulonimbus clouds (10-17 km) is balanced by a mass flux convergence of clear-sky radiative descent. The pseudoadiabatic temperature stratification of the micitroposphere (5-10 km) suppresses cloud outflow in this interval. The detrainment profile in the deep outflow layer is shifted downward by about 1.5 km from the profile one would anticipate based on undilute pseudoadiabatic ascent of air from the boundary layer. The main source of water vapor to most of the tropical troposphere is evaporative moistening. Below 12 km, evaporatively forced descent plays an important role in the vertical mass flux budget of the Tropics. This dives rise to a coupling, between the water vapor and mass flux budgets, which, between 5 and 10 km, provides a constraint on the variation of relative humidity with height. Between 12 and 15 km, the observed relative humidity profile can be reproduced by assuming a simple first-order balance between detrainment moistening and subsidence drying. The mean ozone profile of the Tropics can be reproduced using a simple one-dimensional model constrained by the cloud mass flux divergence profile of the diagnostic model.},

The observations show a systematic phase lag, increasing with altitude, between the annual cycle in q(E) and the annual cycle in q at higher altitudes, The observed phase lag agrees with the phase lag calculated assuming advection by the transformed Eulerian-mean vertical velocity of a q(E) crudely estimated from 100-hPa temperatures, which we use as a convenient proxy for tropopause temperatures, The phase agreement confirms the overall robustness of the calculation and strongly supports the tape recorder hypothesis, Establishing a quantitative link between q(E) and observed tropopause temperatures, however, proves difficult because the process of marking the tape depends subtly on both small- and large-scale processes, The tape speed, or large-scale upward advection speed, has a substantial annual variation and a smaller variation due to the quasi-biennial oscillation, which delays or accelerates the arrival of the signal by a month or two in the middle stratosphere. As the tape moves upward, the signal is attenuated with an e-folding time of about 7 to 9 months between 100 and 50 hPa and about 15 to 18 months between 50 and 20 hPa, constraining possible orders of magnitude both of vertical diffusion K-z and of rates of mixing in from the extratropics.

These changes have the potential to alter boundary-layer conditions and ultimately feedback to local and regional climate. We measured radiative and energy fluxes over burnt and unburnt tropical savanna near Howard Springs, Darwin, Australia. At the burnt site a low to moderate intensity fire, ranging between 1,000 and 3,500 kW m(-1), initially affected the land surface by removing all understorey vegetation, charring and blackening the ground surface, scorching the overstorey canopy and reducing the albedo. A reduction in latent heat fluxes to almost zero was seen immediately after the fire when the canopy was scorched. This was then followed by an increase in the sensible heat flux and a large increase in the ground heat flux over the burnt surface. Tethered balloon measurements showed that, despite the presence of pre-monsoonal rain events occurring during the measurement period, the lower boundary layer over the burnt site was up to 2 degrees C warmer than that over the unburnt site. This increase in boundary-layer heating when applied to fire scars at the landscape scale can have the ability to form or alter local mesoscale circulations and ultimately create a feedback to regional heating and precipitation patterns that may affect larger-scale processes such as the Australian monsoon.},

	abstract = {During boreal summer, much of the water vapor and CO entering the global tropical stratosphere is transported over the Asian monsoon/Tibetan Plateau (TP) region. Studies have suggested that most of this transport is carried out either by tropical convection over the South Asian monsoon region or by extratropical convection over southern China. By using measurements from the newly available National Aeronautics and Space Administration Aura Microwave Limb Sounder, along with observations from the Aqua and Tropical Rainfall-Measuring Mission satellites, we establish that the TP provides the main pathway for cross-tropopause transport in this region. Tropospheric moist convection driven by elevated surface heating over the TIP is deeper and detrains more water vapor, CO, and ice at the tropopause than over the monsoon area. Warmer tropopause temperatures and slower-failing, smaller cirrus cloud particles in less saturated ambient air at the tropopause also allow more water vapor to travel into the lower stratosphere over the TP, effectively short-circuiting the slower ascent of water vapor across the cold tropical tropopause over the monsoon area. Air that is high in water vapor and CO over the Asian monsoon/TP region enters the lower stratosphere primarily over the TP, and it is then transported toward the Asian monsoon area and disperses into the large-scale upward motion of the global stratospheric circulation. Thus, hydration of the global stratosphere could be especially sensitive to changes of convection over the TP.},

Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of input data, learning tasks and network architectures. Our method is based on deep Taylor decomposition and efficiently utilizes the structure of the network by backpropagating the explanations from the output to the input layer.

During the 1990 dry season, average evaporation diminished from 3.8 to 2.1 mm d-1 as the Bowen ratio increased from 0.43 to 0.67.

	abstract = {[1] Global satellite analyses showing strong correlations between aerosol optical depth and cloud cover have stirred much debate recently. While it is tempting to interpret the results as evidence of aerosol enhancement of cloud cover, other factors such as the influence of meteorology on both the aerosol and cloud distributions can also play a role, as both aerosols and clouds depend upon local meteorology. This study uses satellite observations to examine aerosol-cloud relationships for broken low-level cloud regions off the coast of Africa. The analysis approach minimizes the influence of large-scale meteorology by restricting the spatial and temporal domains in which the aerosol and cloud properties are compared. While distributions of several meteorological variables within 5 degrees x 5 degrees latitude-longitude regions are nearly identical under low and high aerosol optical depth, the corresponding distributions of single-layer low cloud properties and top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes differ markedly, consistent with earlier studies showing increased cloud cover with aerosol optical depth. Furthermore, fine-mode fraction and Angstrom Exponent are also larger in conditions of higher aerosol optical depth, even though no evidence of systematic latitudinal or longitudinal gradients between the low and high aerosol optical depth populations are observed. When the analysis is repeated for all 5 degrees x 5 degrees latitude-longitude regions over the global oceans ( after removing cases in which significant meteorological differences are found between the low and high aerosol populations), results are qualitatively similar to those off the coast of Africa.},

For example, direct evaporation of rain contributes significantly to the heat and moisture budgets of clouds(5), but few observations of these processes are available(6). Similarly, the relative contributions to atmospheric moisture over land from local evaporation and humidity from oceanic sources are uncertain(3,7). Lighter isotopes of water vapour preferentially evaporate whereas heavier isotopes preferentially condense(8-10) and the isotopic composition of ocean water is known. Here we use this information combined with global measurements of the isotopic composition of tropospheric water vapour from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard the Aura spacecraft(11,12), to investigate aspects of the atmospheric hydrological cycle that are not well constrained by observations of precipitation or atmospheric vapour content. Our measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapour near tropical clouds suggest that rainfall evaporation contributes significantly to lower troposphere humidity, with typically 20\% and up to 50\% of rainfall evaporating near convective clouds. Over the tropical continents the isotopic signature of tropospheric water vapour differs significantly from that of precipitation(8,10,13), suggesting that convection of vapour from both oceanic sources and evapotranspiration are the dominant moisture sources. Our measurements allow an assessment of the intensity of the present hydrological cycle and will help identify any future changes as they occur.},

This produces a net cloud forcing of -5 W m(-2) in the tropics and warms the upper tropical troposphere over 3 degrees C.

This study makes use of radar observations from the Norman, Oklahoma, polarimetric Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler, three-dimensional lightning mapping data from the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), and balloon-borne vector electric field meter (EFM) measurements. The storm had a low flash rate (30 flashes in 40 min). Four charge regions were inferred from a combination of LMA and EFM data. Lower positive charge near 4 km and midlevel negative charge from 4.5 to 6 km MSL (from 0 degrees to -6.5 degrees C) were generated in and adjacent to a vigorous updraft pulse. Further midlevel negative charge from 4.5 to 6 km MSL and upper positive charge from 6 to 8 km ( from -6.5 degrees to -19 degrees C) were generated later in quantity sufficient to initiate lightning as the updraft decayed. A negative screening layer was present near the storm top (8.5 km MSL, -25 degrees C). Initial lightning flashes were between lower positive and midlevel negative charge and started occurring shortly after a cell began lofting hydrometeors into the mixed phase region, where graupel was formed. A leader from the storm's first flash avoided a region where polarimetric radar suggested wet growth and the resultant absence of noninductive charging of those hydrometeors. Initiation locations of later flashes that propagated into the upper positive charge tracked the descending location of a polarimetric signature of graupel. As the storm decayed, electric fields greater than 160 kV m(-1) exceeded the minimum threshold for lightning initiation suggested by the hypothesized runaway breakdown process at 5.5 km MSL, but lightning did not occur. The small spatial extent (approximate to 100 m) of the large electric field may not have been sufficient to allow runaway breakdown to fully develop and initiate lightning.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {Multispectral analyses of satellite images are used to calculate the evolution of the effective radius of convective cloud particles with temperature, and to infer from that information about precipitation forming processes in the clouds. Different microphysical processes are identified at different heights. From cloud base to top, the microphysical classification includes zones of diffusional droplet growth, coalescence droplet growth, rainout, mixed-phase precipitation, and glaciation. Not all zones need appear in a given cloud system. Application to maritime clouds shows, from base to top, zones of coalescence, rainout, a shallow mixed-phase region, and glaciation starting at -10 degrees C or even warmer. In contrast continental clouds have a deep diffusional growth zone above their bases, followed by coalescence and mixed-phase zones, and glaciation at -15 degrees to -20 degrees C. Highly continental clouds have a narrow or no coalescence zone, a deep mixed-phase zone, and glaciation occurring between -20 degrees and -30 degrees C. Limited aircraft validation for the satellite inferences over Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia is available.Substantial transformation in the microphysical and precipitation forming processes is observed by this method in convective clouds developing in air masses moving from the sea inland. These changes appear to be related to the modification of the maritime air mass as it moves inland and becomes more continental. Further transformations are observed in air masses moving into areas affected by biomass burning smoke or urban air pollution, such that coalescence, and thus precipitation, is suppressed even in deep tropical clouds. It follows that natural and anthropogenic aerosols can substantially modify clouds not only in pristine environments, as was already demonstrated by the ship tracks, but they can also incur profound impact on cloud microstructure and precipitation in more continental environments, leading to substantial weather modification in densely populated areas.},

	abstract = {According to observations of hurricanes located relatively close to the land, intense and persistent lightning takes place within a 250-300-km radius ring around the hurricane center, whereas the lightning activity in the eyewall takes place only during comparatively short periods usually attributed to eyewall replacement. The mechanism responsible for the formation of the maximum flash density at the tropical cyclone (TC) periphery is not well understood as yet. In this study it is hypothesized that lightning at the TC periphery arises under the influence of small continental aerosol particles (APs), which affect the microphysics and the dynamics of clouds at the TC periphery. To show that aerosols change the cloud microstructure and the dynamics to foster lightning formation, the authors use a 2D mixed-phase cloud model with spectral microphysics. It is shown that aerosols that penetrate the cloud base of maritime clouds dramatically increase the amount of supercooled water, as well as the ice contents and vertical velocities. As a result, in clouds developing in the air with high AP concentration, ice crystals, graupel, frozen drops and/or hail, and supercooled water can coexist within a single cloud zone, which allows collisions and charge separation. The simulation of possible aerosol effects on the landfalling tropical cyclone has been carried out using a 3-km-resolution Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) mesoscale model. It is shown that aerosols change the cloud microstructure in a way that permits the attribution of the observed lightning structure to the effects of continental aerosols. It is also shown that aerosols, which invigorate clouds at 250-300 km from the TC center, decrease the convection intensity in the TC center, leading to some TC weakening. The results suggest that aerosols change the intensity and the spatial distribution of precipitation in landfalling TCs and can possibly contribute to the weekly cycle of the intensity and precipitation of landfalling TCs. More detailed investigations of the TC-aerosol interaction are required.},

	abstract = {Cloud-to-ground lightning flash locations were examined for nine Atlantic basin hurricanes using data from the National Lightning Detection Network. A common radial distribution in ground flash density was evident: a weak maximum in the eyewall region, a clear minimum 80-100 km outside the eyewall, and a strong maximum in the vicinity of outer rainbands (210-290-km radius). These results are consistent with the authors' previous study of Hurricane Andrew. None of the storms showed this characteristic radial structure during prehurricane stages.The results support the division of precipitation in the hurricane into three distinct regimes. The eyewall is a unique phenomenon but shares some attributes with deep, weakly electrified oceanic monsoonal convection. The region outside the eyewall and under the central dense overcast has characteristics of the trailing stratiform region of mesoscale convective systems, including a relatively high fraction of positive polarity flashes. The outer bands, with mean maximum flash density at the 250-km radius, contain the vast majority of ground flashes in the storms.Eyewall lightning, defined as that within 40 km of the center, was examined for four moderate-to-strong hurricanes. Such lightning occurred episodically during hurricane stage, with 93\% of hourly intervals containing no detected flashes. Eyewall lightning outbreaks over water always occurred at the beginning of or during times of intensification, but often were indicative of the imminent end of deepening. IL is proposed that the existence of such inner core lightning might reveal the presence of an eyewall cycle. For the one storm with available aircraft reconnaissance data, eyewall cycles were reliably identified by the occurrence of inner core lightning, and inner core lightning appeared only during such cycles. Suggestions are made as to how eyewall Rashes in existing hurricanes might be used to help predict hurricane intensity change.},

The maritime case is from observations made on 18 September 1974 during the Global Atmospheric Research Program's Atlantic Tropical Experiment ( GATE). The continental storm cases are those of summertime Texas clouds observed on 13 August 1999, and green-ocean, smoky, and pyro-clouds observed during the Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia-Smoke, Aerosols, Clouds, Rainfall, and Climate ( LBA-SMOCC) campaign on 1-4 October 2002. Simulations have been performed for these cases with a detailed melting scheme. This scheme allows calculation of liquid water fraction within each mass bin for the melting of graupel, hail, snowflakes, and crystals, as well as alteration of the sedimentation velocity of ice particles in the course of their melting. The results obtained with the detailed melting scheme are compared with corresponding results from simulations involving instantaneous melting at the freezing ( 0 degrees C) level.The detailed melting scheme allows penetration of ice from the freezing level down into the boundary layer by distances ranging from a few hundred meters for the numerous, smaller particles to similar to 1.5 km for the largest particles, which are much scarcer. In these simulations, most of the mass of ice falling out melts over this short distance of a few hundred meters. The deepening and intensification of the layer of latent cooling enhances the convective destabilization of the troposphere. This effect is especially pronounced under continental conditions, causing significant changes in the accumulated rain amount.},

	abstract = {Present-day shortcomings in the representation of upper tropospheric ice clouds in general circulation models (GCMs) lead to errors in weather and climate forecasts as well as account for a source of uncertainty in climate change projections. An ongoing challenge in rectifying these shortcomings has been the availability of adequate, high-quality, global observations targeting ice clouds and related precipitating hydrometeors. In addition, the inadequacy of the modeled physics and the often disjointed nature between model representation and the characteristics of the retrieved/observed values have hampered GCM development and validation efforts from making effective use of the measurements that have been available. Thus, even though parameterizations in GCMs accounting for cloud ice processes have, in some cases, become more sophisticated in recent years, this development has largely occurred independently of the global-scale measurements. With the relatively recent addition of satellite-derived products from Aura/Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and CloudSat, there are now considerably more resources with new and unique capabilities to evaluate GCMs. In this article, we illustrate the shortcomings evident in model representations of cloud ice through a comparison of the simulations assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, briefly discuss the range of global observational resources that are available, and describe the essential components of the model parameterizations that characterize their "cloud” ice and related fields. Using this information as background, we (1) discuss some of the main considerations and cautions that must be taken into account in making model-data comparisons related to cloud ice, (2) illustrate present progress and uncertainties in applying satellite cloud ice (namely from MLS and CloudSat) to model diagnosis, (3) show some indications of model improvements, and finally (4) discuss a number of remaining questions and suggestions for pathways forward.},

The effective radius of ice crystals, which is used in the radiation and gravitational settlement calculations, is now calculated from model-predicted mass and number of ice crystals rather than diagnosed as a function of temperature. A water vapor deposition scheme is added to replace the condensation and evaporation (C-E) in the standard CAM3 for ice clouds. The repartitioning of total water into liquid and ice in mixed-phase clouds as a function of temperature is removed, and ice supersaturation is allowed. The predicted ice water content in the modified CAM3 is in better agreement with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data than that in the standard CAM3. The cirrus cloud fraction near the tropical tropopause, which is underestimated in the standard CAM3 as revealed through comparison with the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) data, is increased by 20\%-30\%, and the cold temperature bias there is reduced by 1-2 K. However, an increase in the cloud fraction in polar regions makes the underestimation ( by similar to 20 W m(-2)) of downwelling shortwave radiation in the standard CAM3 even worse. A sensitivity test reducing the threshold relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) for heterogeneous ice nucleation from 120\% to 105\% (representing nearly perfect ice nuclei) increases the global cloud cover by 1.4\%, temperature near the tropical tropopause by 4-5 K, and water vapor in the stratosphere by 50\%-80\%.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems are composed of numerous deep convective cells with varying amounts of large, convectively produced ice particles aloft. The magnitude of the 85-GHz brightness temperature depression resulting from scattering by large ice is believed to be related to the convective intensity and to the magnitude of the convective fluxes through a deep layer. The 85-GHz ice-scattering signature can be used to map the distribution of organized mesoscale regions of convectively produced large ice particles. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the usefulness of the 85-GHz ice-scattering signature for describing the frequency, convective intensity, and geographic distribution of mesoscale convective systems.Objective criteria were developed to identify mesoscale convective systems from raw data from January, April, July, and October 1993. To minimize the effects of background contamination and to ensure that bounded areas contained convective elements, a ”mesoscale convective system” was defined as an area bounded by 250 K of at least 2000 km(2) of 85 GHz, with a minimum brightness temperature less than or equal to 225 K. Mesoscale convective systems extracted from the raw data were sorted and plotted by their areas and by their minimum brightness temperatures. Four area and brightness temperature classes were used to account for a spectrum of organized convection ranging from small to very large and from less organized to highly organized. The populations of mesoscale convective systems by this study's definition were consistent with infrared-based climatologies and large-scale seasonal dynamics. Land/water differences were highlighted by the plots of minimum brightness temperature. Most of the intense mesoscale convective systems were located on or near land and seemed to occur most frequently in particular areas in North America, South America, Africa, and India.},

	abstract = {The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted ”reanalysis”) to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system.The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Gray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a ”quick look” CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CDROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, ”C” variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems.The 40 years of reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data.NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on climate through both direct and indirect effects. Several extensive investigations and coordinated field campaigns have been carried out to assess the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on climate. However, there are far fewer studies on natural aerosols than on anthropogenic aerosols, despite their importance. Natural aerosols are particularly important because they provide a kind of base level to aerosol impact, and there is no effective control on them, unlike their anthropogenic counterparts. Besides, on a global scale the abundance of natural aerosols is several times greater than that of the major anthropogenic aerosols (sulphate, soot and organics). The major natural aerosol components are sea salt, soil dust, natural sulphates. volcanic aerosols, and those generated by natural forest fires. As with anthropogenic aerosols, the abundance of natural aerosols such as soil dust is also increasing, due to processes such as deforestation, which exposes more land areas which may then interact directly with the atmosphere, and due to other human activities. Since a major fraction of the natural aerosol (sea salt and natural sulphate) is of the non-absorbing type (and hygroscopic), it partly offsets the warming due to greenhouse gases as well as that due to absorbing aerosols (e.g., soot). The mineral dust transported over land and ocean causes surface cooling (due to scattering and absorption) simultaneously with lower atmospheric heating (due to absorption); this could in turn intensify a low-level inversion and increase atmospheric stability and reduce convection. To accurately predict the impact of dust aerosols on climate, the spatial and temporal distribution of dust is essential. The regional characteristics of dust source function are poorly understood due to the lack of an adequate database. The reduction of solar radiation at the surface would lead to a reduction in the sensible heat flux and all these will lead to perturbations in the regional and global climate. Enhanced concentration of sea salt aerosols at high wind speed would lead to more condensation nuclei, increase in the cloud droplet concentration and hence cloud albedo. Even though direct radiative impacts due to sea salt and natural sulphate are small compared to those due to anthropogenic counterparts, their indirect effects (and the uncertainties) are much larger. There is a considerable uncertainty in sea salt aerosol radiative forcing due to an inadequate database over oceans. The presence of natural aerosols may influence the radiative impact of anthropogenic aerosols, and it is difficult to separate the natural and anthropogenic aerosol contributions to radiative forcing when they are in a mixed state. Hence it is necessary to document the radiative effects of natural aerosols, especially in the tropics where the natural sources are strong. This is the subject matter of this review.

	abstract = {A global three-dimensional model is used to examine the export of anthropogenic sulfur from northern midlatitude continents and to assess the relative importance of anthropogenic and natural sources to sulfate levels in different regions of the troposphere. Model results indicate that about 40\% of the anthropogenic sulfur emitted in the United States, Europe, or eastern Asia is exported out of the continental boundary layer of these regions; the rest is removed within the regions, primarily by dry deposition of SO2 and wet deposition of SO42-. Export is relatively more efficient in summer than in winter. There is little nonlinearity between the magnitude of sulfur emissions in the northern midlatitude continents and the export of this sulfur to the global atmosphere. Anthropogenic influence on SO42- decreases rapidly with altitude because of efficient scavenging of SO2 and SO42- in deep convective updrafts. Thus it is found that anthropogenic influence accounts on average for less than 20\% of SO42- anywhere in the upper troposphere. The main source of SO42- in the tropical upper troposphere in the model is from biogenic dimethylsulfide (DMS) pumped in deep convective events. Volcanic emissions account for 20-40\% of SO42- in much of the middle troposphere and for up to 80\% over the North Pacific; they also represent a major contributor to SO42- in the upper troposphere at high latitudes. On a global scale, it is estimated that anthropogenic, biogenic, and volcanic emissions account for 70\%, 23\%, and 7\%, respectively, of the global sulfur source, but that they account for 37\%, 42\%, and 18\%, respectively, of the global column of atmospheric SO42-. The disproportionality between source and column contribution reflects the rapid deposition of anthropogenic SO2 and SO42- at low altitudes. It thus appears that the anthropogenic contribution to the SO42- aerosol optical depth is much less than would be expected simply on the basis of emissions.},

	abstract = {A survey of reports of electrical activity in hurricanes and typhoons from flight notes and personal experience ( 18 years, {\textgreater}230 eyewall penetrations for R. A. Black; similar to 20 years for J. Hallett, plus that of others at the Hurricane Research Division), and perusal of flight notes dating from 1980, show that lightning in and within 100 km or so of the eyewall is usually sparse. However, occasionally, significant electrical activity ({\textgreater}one flash per minute) occurs in or near the eyewall. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration WP-3D aircraft penetrations through a number of storms relate the lightning occurrence to strong vertical velocity ({\textgreater}10 m s(-1)) and the presence of supercooled liquid cloud droplets extending To temperatures below -20 degrees C, Specific measurements of cloud properties during eyewall penetrations show that the supercooled cloud water content increases with upward velocities {\textgreater}similar to 5.0 m s(-1), as does the presence of large ({\textgreater}2 mm) supercooled drops. Measurements at temperatures {\textgreater}-13 degrees C show that the transition of supercooled cloud water to ice along an outward radial in all systems is associated with local electric fields (occasionally {\textgreater}20 kV m(-1)) and negative charge above positive charge. In systems with stronger vertical velocity there is a larger region of supercooled cloud extending to lower temperatures where charge separation may occur, as judged by the presence of regions containing graupel, small ice, and cloud droplets. The ratio of ice to supercooled water increases radially outward from the eyewall and depends upon altitude (temperature). The spatial distribution of charge is further influenced by the relation of vertical velocity to the radial flow, with the upper charge regions tending to be advected outward. In symmetrical, mature hurricanes, supercooled water usually occurs only in regions at temperatures above about -5 degrees C.The upward transport of supercooled cloud water is limited by a balance between water condensed in the eyewall updraft and its erosion by ice in downdrafts descending in the outward regions of the eyewall. This ice originates from both primary and secondary ice nucleation in the updraft. This is consistent with an exponential increase in ice concentration, as the rare at which the ice particle concentrations increase depends on the production of secondary particles by preexisting graupel, some of which ultimately grow into new graupel. and its outward transport in the anvil how aloft. Penetrations at temperatures as low as -15 degrees C show the presence of electric fields consistent with specific laboratory-derived criteria for charge separated during ice-graupel collisions, given that a liquid water-dependent sign reversal temperature may occur. Such a reversal may result from either a changing temperature in the vertical, a changing cloud liquid water content in the horizontal, or a combination of the two.Since cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning can be observed with remote detection networks that provide the polarity and frequency of CG lightning, there is potential that hurricane evolution may be detected remotely and that lightning may be usable as an indicator of a change in the storm intensity and/or track.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391v3},
	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine GradCAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on weakly-supervised localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we conduct human studies to measure if GradCAM explanations help users establish trust in predictions from deep networks and show that GradCAM helps untrained users successfully discern a "stronger" deep network from a "weaker" one. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam. A demo and a video of the demo can be found at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org and youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

	abstract = {The inclusion of cloud microphysical processes in general circulation models makes it possible to study the multiple interactions among clouds, the hydrological cycle, and radiation. The gaps between the temporal and spatial scales at which such cloud microphysical processes work and those at which general circulation models presently function force climate modelers to crudely parameterize and simplify the various interactions among the different water species (namely, water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow) and to use adjustable parameters to which large-scale models can be highly sensitive. Accordingly, the authors have investigated the sensitivity of the climate, simulated with the Colorado State University general circulation model, to various aspects of the parameterization of cloud microphysical processes and its interactions with the cumulus convection and radiative transfer parameterizations.The results of 120-day sensitivity experiments corresponding to perpetual January conditions have been compared with those of a control simulation in order to 1) determine the importance of advecting cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow at the temporal and spatial scale resolutions presently used in the model; 2) study the importance of the formation of extended stratiform anvils at the tops of cumulus towers; 3) analyze the role of mixed-phase clouds in determining the partitioning among cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow and, hence, their impacts on the simulated cloud optical properties; 4) evaluate the sensitivity of the atmosphere ic moisture budget and precipitation rates to a change in the fall velocities of rain and snow; 5) determine the model's sensitivity to the prescribed thresholds of autoconversion of cloud water to rain and cloud ice to snow; and 6) study the impact of the collection of supercooled cloud water by snow, as well as accounting fur the cloud optical properties of snow.Results are presented in terms of 30-day mean differences between the sensitivity experiments and control run. The authors find that three-dimensional advection of the water species has little influence on their geographical distributions and globally averaged amounts. The simulated climate remains unchanged when detrained condensed water at the tops of cumulus towers is used as a source of rain and snow rather than as a source of cloud water and cloud ice. In contrast, instantaneously removing cloud water and cloud ice detrained at the tops of cumulus towers in the form of precipitation yields a strong drying of the atmosphere and a significant reduction in the size of the anvils. Altering the partitioning between cloud ice and supercooled cloud water produces significant changes in the vertical distributions of the cloud optical depth and effective cloud Fraction, hence producing significant variations in the top-of-the-atmosphere longwave and shortwave cloud radiative forcings. Increasing the fall speeds of rain and snow leads to a decrease in cloudiness and an increase in stratiform rainfall. Increasing the thresholds for autoconversion of cloud water to rain and cloud ice to snow yields a significant increase in middle- and high-level clouds and a reduction of the cumulus precipitation rate. The collection of supercooled cloud water by snow appeared to be an important microphysical process for mixed-phase clouds. Finally, the optical effects of snow have little impact upon the top-of-the-atmosphere radiation budget.This study illustrates the need for in-depth analysis of the spatial and temporal scale dependence of the different microphysical parameters of the cloud parameterizations used in general circulation models.},

	abstract = {Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89.0\% and 82.1\% without any post-processing.

	abstract = {A parametrization for ice supersaturation is introduced into the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS), compatible with the cloud scheme that allows partial cloud coverage. It is based on the simple, but often justifiable, diagnostic assumption that the ice nucleation and subsequent depositional growth time-scales are short compared to the model time step, thus supersaturation is only permitted in the clear-sky portion of the grid cell.Results from model integrations using the new scheme are presented, which is demonstrated to increase uppertropospheric humidity, decrease high-level cloud cover and, to a much lesser extent, cloud ice amounts, all as expected from simple arguments. Evaluation of the relative distribution of supersaturated humidity amounts shows good agreement with the observed climatology derived from in situ aircraft observations. With the new scheme, the global distribution of frequency of occurrence of supersaturated regions compares well with remotely sensed microwave limb sounder (MLS) data, with the most marked errors of underprediction occurring in regions where the model is known to underpredict deep convection. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the new scheme leads to improved predictions of permanent contrail cloud over southern England, which indirectly implies upper-tropospheric humidity fields are better represented for this region.

Cloud-aerosol interactions dominate not only the dynamics of marine shallow clouds, but also the lifetime and the vertical disposition of latent heat of deep convective clouds over ocean and even more strongly over land. Recent coincident satellite measurements of aerosols and cloud properties quantify the aerosol effects on cloud cover and radiative forcing on regional and global scales. The shapes of the satellite retrieved relations between aerosols and cloud properties are consistent with the suggested ways by which aerosols affect clouds via precipitation processes, particularly by affecting the intensity of the cloud vertical air motions and its vertical development.},

	abstract = {A prognostic cloud scheme named McRAS (Microphysics of Clouds with Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert Scheme) has been designed and developed with the aim of improving moist processes, microphysics of clouds, and cloud-radiation interactions in GCMs. McRAS distinguishes three types of clouds: convective, stratiform, and boundary layer. The convective clouds transform and merge into stratiform clouds on an hourly timescale, while the boundary layer clouds merge into the stratiform clouds instantly. The cloud condensate converts into precipitation following the autoconversion equations of Sundqvist that contain a parametric adaptation for the Berperon-Findeisen process of ice crystal growth and collection of cloud condensate by precipitation. All clouds convect, advect, as well as diffuse both horizontally and vertically with a fully interactive cloud microphysics throughout the life cycle of the cloud, while the optical properties of clouds are derived from the statistical distribution of hydrometeors and idealized cloud geometry.An evaluation of McRAS in a single-column model (SCM) with the Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) Phase III data has shown that, together with the rest of the model physics, McRAS can simulate the observed temperature, humidity, and precipitation without discernible systematic errors. The time history and time mean in-cloud water and ice distribution, fractional cloudiness, cloud optical thickness, origin of precipitation in the convective anvils and towers, and the convective updraft and downdraft velocities and mass fluxes all simulate a realistic behavior. Some of these diagnostics are not verifiable with data on hand. These SCM sensitivity tests show that (i) without clouds the simulated GATE-SCM atmosphere is cooler than observed; (ii) the model's convective scheme, RAS, is an important subparameterization of McRAS; and (iii) advection of cloud water substance is helpful in simulating better cloud distribution and cloud-radiation interaction. An evaluation of the performance of McRAS in the Goddard Earth Observing System II GCM is given in a companion paper (Part II).},

	abstract = {The photochemistry of the troposphere over the South Atlantic basin is examined by modeling of aircraft observations up to 12-km altitude taken during the TRACE A expedition in September-October 1992. A close balance is found in the 0 to 12-km column between photochemical production and loss of O-3, With net production at high altitudes compensating for weak net loss at low altitudes. This balance implies that O-3 concentrations in the 0-12 km column can be explained solely by in situ photochemistry; influx from the stratosphere is negligible. Simulation of H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O concentrations measured aboard the aircraft lends confidence in the computations of O-3 production and loss rates, although there appeals to be a major gap in current understanding of CH2O chemistry in the marine boundary layer. The primary sources of NOx over the South Atlantic Basin appear to be continental (biomass burning, lightning, soils). There is evidence that NOx throughout the 0 to 12-km column is recycled from its oxidation products rather than directly transported fi om its primary sources. There is also evidence for rapid conversion of HNO3 to NOx in the upper troposphere by a mechanism not included in current models. A general representation of the O-3 budget in the tropical troposphere is proposed that couples the large-scale Walker circulation and in situ photochemistry. Deep convection in the rising branches of the Walker circulation injects NOx from combustion, soils, and lightning to the upper troposphere, leading to O-3 production; eventually, the air subsides and net O-3 loss takes place in the lower troposphere, closing the O-3 cycle. This scheme implies a great sensitivity of the oxidizing power of the atmosphere to NOx emissions in the tropics.},

	abstract = {This paper begins a study on the role of lightning in maintaining the global distribution of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the troposphere. It presents the first global and seasonal distributions of lightning-produced NOx (LNO(x)) based on the observed distribution of electrical storms and the physical properties of lightning strokes. We derive a global rate for cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes of 20-30 flashes/s with a mean energy per flash of 6.7 x 10(9) J. Intracloud (IC) flashes are more frequent, 50-70 flashes/s but have 10\% of the energy of CG strokes and, consequently, produce significantly less NOx. It appears to us that the majority of previous studies have mistakenly assumed that all lightning flashes produce the same amount of NOx, thus overestimating the NOx production by a factor of 3. On the other hand, we feel these same studies have underestimated the energy released in CG flashes, resulting in two negating assumptions. For CG energies we adopt a production rate of 10 x 10(16) molecules NO/J based on the current literature. Using a method to simulate global lightning frequencies from satellite-observed cloud data, we have calculated the LNO(x) on various spatial (regional, zonal, meridional, and global) and temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, and interannual). Regionally, the production of LNO, is concentrated over tropical continental regions, predominantly in the summer hemisphere. The annual mean production rate is calculated to be 12.2 Tg N/yr, and we believe it extremely unlikely that this number is less than 5 or more than 20 Tg N/yr. Although most of LNO(x) is produced in the lowest 5 km by CG lightning, convective mixing in the thunderstorms is likely to deposit large amounts of NOx in the upper troposphere where it is important in ozone production. On an annual basis, 64\% of the LNO(x) is produced in the northern hemisphere, implying that the northern hemisphere should have natural ozone levels as much as 2 times greater than the southern hemisphere, even before anthropogenic influences. The amount of O-3 produced from this NOx is expected to exceed the stratospheric source by a factor of 1.5, and thus the hemispheric asymmetry in LNO(x) would lead to a significant excess of northern hemisphere O-3 even in the preindustrial troposphere. (The monthly climatologies for LNO(x) on a 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude-longitude grid can be obtained by e-mail to cprice@flash.tau.ac.il.).},

	abstract = {Detailed shortwave and longwave radiative transfer models are used to calculate the radiative forcing and temperature trends due to stratospheric ozone depletion. These were calculated using the fixed dynamical heating approximation to adjust the stratospheric temperatures. Recent estimates of stratospheric ozone loss between 1979 and 1991 (from solar backscattered ultraviolet (SBUV) and stratospheric aerosol and gas experiment (SAGE) instruments) and updated radiative transfer schemes are used to obtain improved estimates of the radiative forcings. An annually and globally averaged radiative forcing of -0.13 +/- 0.02 W m(-2) decade(-1) (-0.22 +/- 0.03 W m(-2) for the 1979-1996 period) was found from SBUV total column ozone trends, applying a constant percentage ozone depletion to a 7 km thick layer directly above the tropopause SAGE ozone trends gave forcing estimates of -0.10 +/- 0.02 W m(-2) decade(-1) (-0.17 +/- 0.03 W m for the 1979-1996 period), although assumptions needed to be made about the choice of the vertical profile of the ozone depletion below 17 km. Using Dobson instrument trends from 1964 to 1996, the total ozone forcing could be as negative as -0.26 +/- 0.05 W m(-2). The quoted error bars derive from uncertainties in the total ozone trends. Using these values, the stratospheric ozone change may have offset about 30\% of the forcing due to increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases since 1979, and about 15\% of the forcing since 1964, at least on a global and annual mean. The ozone forcings are shown to be nearly a linear function of the ozone amount depleted from the atmospheric column, provided the vertical profile of the depletion remains constant. As in previous studies, it was found that stratospheric adjustment altered the sign of the ozone forcing by strongly cooling the lower stratosphere. It is shown that (depending on the vertical structure of ozone depletion) coolings of up to 0.4 K decade(-1) can be found at altitudes of 35 km; this provides a mechanism for cooling the stratosphere nearly as large as that from well-mixed greenhouse gas increases, at altitudes where ozone changes were previously thought not to strongly affect stratospheric temperature trends. Previous studies have examined the effect of ozone trends by looking at the response of the surface temperature to a fixed absolute ozone change at different heights in the atmosphere. We argue that using absolute ozone perturbations places an unrealistically large emphasis on ozone changes near the tropopause. As the vertical profile of ozone change is more often reported as a percentage change, we present the sensitivity of the surface temperature to constant percentage, rather than absolute, changes in ozone.},

There is limited direct evidence for changes in the earth's oxidizing capacity since recent preindustrial times when, because of industrial and population growth, increasing amounts of O3 precursor trace gases (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons) have been released into the atmosphere. The concentrations of O3 and possibly H2O2 have increased over large regions. Models predict that tropospheric O3 will increase approximately 0.3 to 1\% per year over the next 50 years with both positive and negative trends possible for OH and H2O2.

	abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard both NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites is making near-global daily observations of the earth in a wide spectral range (0.41-15 mu m). These measurements are used to derive spectral aerosol optical thickness and aerosol size parameters over both land and ocean. The aerosol products available over land include aerosol optical thickness at three visible wavelengths, a measure of the fraction of aerosol optical thickness attributed to the fine mode, and several derived parameters including reflected spectral solar flux at the top of the atmosphere. Over the ocean, the aerosol optical thickness is provided in seven wavelengths from 0.47 to 2.13 mu m. In addition, quantitative aerosol size information includes effective radius of the aerosol and quantitative fraction of optical thickness attributed to the fine mode. Spectral irradiance contributed by the aerosol, mass concentration, and number of cloud condensation nuclei round out the list of available aerosol products over the ocean. The spectral optical thickness and effective radius of the aerosol over the ocean are validated by comparison with two years of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data gleaned from 132 AERONET stations. Eight thousand MODIS aerosol retrievals collocated with AERONET measurements confirm that one standard deviation of MODIS optical thickness retrievals fall within the predicted uncertainty of Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau over ocean and Delta tau = +/- 0.05 +/- 0.15 tau over land. Two hundred and seventy-one MODIS aerosol retrievals collocated with AERONET inversions at island and coastal sites suggest that one standard deviation of MODIS effective radius retrievals falls within Delta r(eff) = +/- 0.11 mu m. The accuracy of the MODIS retrievals suggests that the product can be used to help narrow the uncertainties associated with aerosol radiative forcing of global climate.},

The space-based observations are tropospheric NO2 columns from SCIAMACHY, tropospheric O-3 columns from OMI and MLS, and upper tropospheric HNO3 from ACE-FTS. A global chemical transport model ( GEOS-Chem) is used to identify locations and time periods in which lightning would be expected to dominate the trace gas observations. The satellite observations are sampled at those locations and time periods. All three observations exhibit a maximum in the tropical Atlantic region and a minimum in the tropical Pacific. This wave-1 pattern is driven by injection of lightning NO into the upper troposphere over the tropical continents, followed by photochemical production of NO2, HNO3, and O-3 during transport. Lightning produces a broad enhancement over the tropical Atlantic and Africa of 2-6 x 10(14) molecules NO2 cm(-2), 4 x 10(17) molecules O-3 cm(-2) ( 15 Dobson Units), and 125 pptv of upper tropospheric HNO3. The lightning background is 25-50\% weaker over the tropical Pacific. A global source of 6 +/- 2 Tg N yr(-1) from lightning in the model best represents the satellite observations of tropospheric NO2, O-3, and HNO3.},

Under drought conditions, burning in Indonesia is a disproportionate contributor to these emissions, as seen in the 1997/98 haze disaster(1,4). Yet our understanding of the frequency, severity and underlying causes of severe biomass burning in Indonesia is limited because of the absence of satellite data that are useful for fire monitoring before the mid-1990s. Here we present a continuous monthly record of severe burning events from 1960 to 2006 using the visibility reported at airports in the region. We find that these fires cause extremely poor air quality conditions and that they occur only during years when precipitation falls below a well defined threshold. Historically, large fire events have occurred in Sumatra at least since the 1960s. By contrast, the first large fires are recorded in Kalimantan ( Indonesian Borneo) in the 1980s, despite earlier severe droughts. We attribute this difference to different patterns of changes in land use and population density. Fires in Indonesia have often been linked with El Nino(1,2,5-12), but we find that the Indian Ocean Dipole pattern is as important a contributing factor.},

	abstract = {A new physical inversion-based algorithm for retrieving rain rate over the ocean with the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) is described. In a departure from other rain rate retrieval algorithms, the satellite observables inverted in the present algorithm are not the raw brightness temperatures but rather normalized polarizations for 19.35, 37.0, and 85.5 GHz, plus an 85.5 GHz scattering index which is sensitive primarily to ice particles aloft. The normalized polarizations are interpreted as footprint-averages of theoretically derived analytic functions of the column optical depth associated primarily with liquid water. The effective vertical depth of the rain layer is specified as a function of the SSM/I estimated column water vapor.The retrieval algorithm perform an iterative search for a high resolution (12.5 km) rain field which is simultaneously consistent with the 19.35 and 37.0 GHz normalized polarizations. The first-guess rain rate field is supplied by the 85.5 GHz scattering index. At gridpoints for which the rain column optical depth exceeds the dynamic range of the attenuation-based indices, the first-guess field is left essentially unmodified; elsewhere, the required consistency with the 19 and 37 GHz indices usually results in significant modification of the scattering-based rain rate estimates.The algorithm as described here is a prototype implementation which was developed with reference only to idealized theoretical models; empirical improvements to the numerical scheme and the model coefficients will be made in the future as results from the first Precipitation [algorithm] Intercomparison Project 1 (PIP-1) and the second phase of the GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project) Algorithm Intercomparison Project (AIP/2) are analyzed, as well as data from individual validation efforts. Although the algorithm is physically based and uses all SSM/I channels, it is computationally much less demanding than cloud/radiative transfer model-based inversion algorithms published elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Microwave rain rate retrieval algorithms have most often been formulated in terms of the raw brightness temperatures observed by one or more channels of a satellite radiometer. Taken individually, single-channel brightness temperatures generally represent a near-arbitrary combination of positive contributions due to liquid water emission and negative contributions due to scattering by ice and/or visibility of the radiometrically cold ocean surface. Unfortunately, for a given rain rate, emission by liquid water below the freezing level and scattering by ice particles above the freezing level are rather loosely coupled in both a physical and statistical sense. Furthermore, microwave brightness temperatures may vary significantly (approximately 30-70 K) in response to geophysical parameters other than liquid water and precipitation. Because of these complications, physical algorithms which attempt to directly invert observed brightness temperatures have typically relied on the iterative adjustment of detailed microphysical profiles or cloud models, guided by explicit forward microwave radiative transfer calculations.In support of an effort to develop a significantly simpler and more efficient inversion-type rain rate algorithm, the physical information content of two linear transformations of single-frequency, dual-polarization brightness temperatures is studied: the normalized polarization difference P of Petty and Katsaros (1990, 1992), which is intended as a measure of footprint-averaged rain cloud transmittance for a given frequency; and a scattering index S (similar to the polarization corrected temperature of Spencer et al., 1989) which is sensitive almost exclusively to ice. A reverse Monte Carlo radiative transfer model is used to elucidate the qualitative response of these physically distinct single-frequency indices to idealized 3-dimensional rain clouds and to demonstrate their advantages over raw brightness temperatures both as stand-alone indices of precipitation activity and as primary variables in physical, multichannel rain rate retrieval schemes.As a byproduct of the present analysis, it is shown that conventional plane-parallel analyses of the well-known foot-print-filling problem for emission-based algorithms may in some cases give seriously misleading results.},

We demonstrate that the atmospheric boundary layer over the forested areas is more unstable and characterized by larger values of the convective available potential energy ( CAPE) due to greater humidity than that which is found over the deforested area. The shallow convection over the deforested areas is relatively more active than the deep convection over the forested areas.

	abstract = {Shipborne Doppler radar operations were conducted over the western Pacific warm pool during TOGA COARE using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and NOAA TOGA C-band Doppler radars. Occasionally the ships carrying these radars were brought to within 50 km of each other to conduct coordinated dual-Doppler scanning. The dual-Doppler operations were considered a test of the logistical and engineering constraints associated with establishing a seagoing dual-Doppler configuration. A very successful dual-Doppler data collection period took place on 9 February 1993 when an oceanic squall line developed, intensified and propagated through the shipborne dual-Doppler lobes. Later on the same day, NOAA P-3 aircraft sampled a more intense squall line located approximately 400 km to the southeast of the shipborne operations. This study provides an overview of the shipborne dual-Doppler operations, followed by a comparison of the kinematic and precipitation structures of the convective systems sampled by the ships and aircraft. Special emphasis is placed on interpretation of the results relative to the electrical characteristics of each system.Soundings taken in the vicinity of the ship and aircraft cases exhibited similar thermodynamic instability and sheer. Yet Doppler radar analyses suggest that the aircraft case exhibited a larger degree of low-level forcing, stronger updrafts, more precipitation mass in the mixed-phase region of the clouds, and a relatively higher degree of electrification as evidenced by lightning observations. Conversely, convection in the ship case, while producing maximum cloud-top heights of 16 km, was associated with relatively weaker low-level forcing, weaker vertical development above the -5 degrees C level, moderate electric fields at the surface, and Little detectable lightning. Differences in the kinematic and precipitation structures were further manifested in composite vertical profiles of mean convective precipitation and vertical motion. When considered relative to the electrical properties of the two systems, the results provide further circumstantial evidence to support previously hypothesized vertical velocity and radar reflectivity thresholds that must be exceeded in the 0 degrees to -20 degrees C regions of tropical cumulonimbi prior to the occurrence of lightning.},

	abstract = {[ 1] Ozone measurements from the OMI and MLS instruments on board the Aura satellite are used for deriving global distributions of tropospheric column ozone (TCO). TCO is determined using the tropospheric ozone residual method which involves subtracting measurements of MLS stratospheric column ozone (SCO) from OMI total column ozone after adjusting for intercalibration differences of the two instruments using the convective-cloud differential method. The derived TCO field, which covers one complete year of mostly continuous daily measurements from late August 2004 through August 2005, is used for studying the regional and global pollution on a timescale of a few days to months. The seasonal and zonal characteristics of the observed TCO fields are also compared with TCO fields derived from the Global Modeling Initiative's Chemical Transport Model. The model and observations show interesting similarities with respect to zonal and seasonal variations. However, there are notable differences, particularly over the vast region of the Saharan desert.},

Results show that time series of updraft volume in the charging zone (at temperatures colder than -5 degrees C) with vertical velocities greater than either 5 or 10 m s(-1) have clear relationships with total lightning activity (r = 0.93). Furthermore, these relationships between updraft volume and lightning activity for the storm types of the two climate regimes tend to converge when considering only the subfreezing layers of the clouds. Neither the maximum nor the mean updraft speed correlate as well with total lightning activity (r = {\textless}0.8) as updraft volume. Through expanded study designed to explore further regime variability (or lack thereof) of updraft volume-lightning flash rate relationships, better or refined parameterizations for the numerical forecasting of lightning and/or detection and prediction of storm intensity could be realized.},

We examined the concentration (per volume of liquid) and nature of IN in precipitation collected from Montana and Louisiana, the Alps and Pyrenees (France), Ross Island (Antarctica), and Yukon (Canada). The temperature of detectable ice-nucleating activity for more than half of the samples was {\textgreater}= -5 degrees C based on immersion freezing testing. Digestion of the samples with lysozyme (i.e., to hydrolyze bacterial cell walls) led to reductions in the frequency of freezing (0-100\%); heat treatment greatly reduced (95\% average) or completely eliminated ice nucleation at the measured conditions in every sample. These behaviors were consistent with the activity being bacterial and/or proteinaceous in origin. Statistical analysis revealed seasonal similarities between warm-temperature ice-nucleating activities in snow samples collected over 7 months in Montana. Multiple regression was used to construct models with biogeochemical data [major ions, total organic carbon (TOC), particle, and cell concentration) that were accurate in predicting the concentration of microbial cells and biological IN in precipitation based on the concentration of TOC, Ca2+, and NH4+, or TOC, cells, Ca2+, NH4+, K+, PO43-, SO42-, Cl-, and HCO3-. Our results indicate that biological IN are ubiquitous in precipitation and that for some geographic locations the activity and concentration of these particles is related to the season and precipitation chemistry. Thus, our research suggests that biological IN are widespread in the atmosphere and may affect meteorological processes that lead to precipitation.},

Laboratory studies suggest that some mineral dusts and primary biological particles-such as bacteria, pollen and fungi-can act as ice nuclei(3). Here we use aircraftaerosol time-of-flight spectrometry to directly measure the chemistry of individual cloud ice-crystal residues (obtained after evaporation of the ice), which were sampled at high altitude over Wyoming. We show that biological particles and mineral dust comprised most of the ice-crystal residues: mineral dust accounted for similar to 50\% of the residues and biological particles for similar to 33\%. Along with concurrent measurements of cloud ice-crystal and ice-nuclei concentrations, these observations suggest that certain biological and dust particles initiated ice formation in the sampled clouds. Finally, we use a global aerosol model to show long-range transport of desert dust, suggesting that biological particles can enhance the impact of desert dust storms on the formation of cloud ice.},

	abstract = {To develop theories and numerical models of the formation and microstructure of clouds and precipitation, it is necessary to identify the potential sources of ice nuclei in the atmosphere. However, the subject remains an area of debate. According to the most accepted theory, the great majority of atmospheric ice nuclei constitute soil mineral particles. But some evidence appears to favor the hypothesis of a nonnegligible contribution to the population of effective ice nuclei made by biogenic material, living or dead. Moreover, some specific human activities have been identified as prolific sources of particles on which ice crystals can be generated. In contrast, it has also been suggested that some anthropogenic effluents deactivate nuclei naturally occurring in the atmosphere. This paper summarizes present knowledge about the biogenic and anthropogenic sources of atmospheric ice nuclei. Recent research reveals an increasingly greater variety of sources and activities of ice nuclei. However intriguing and potentially significant these findings are, the overall picture emerging from the review is one of inconclusive, and sometimes contradictory, results. A standarization of measurement techniques and a more coordinated and systematic effort in the search for a general theory of heterogeneous ice nucleation are needed to answer the fundamental questions, what is the origin of atmospheric ice nuclei, and what is their activity spectrum?.},

	abstract = {This study introduces two new approaches for determining tropospheric column ozone from satellite data. In the first method, stratospheric column ozone is derived by combining Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) halogen occultation experiment (HALOE) and microwave Limb sounder (MLS) ozone measurements. Tropospheric column ozone is then obtained by subtracting these stratospheric amounts from the total column, Total column ozone in this study include retrievals from Nimbus 7 (November 1978 to May 1993) and Earth probe (July 1996 to present) total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS). Data from HALOE are used in this first method to extend the vertical span of MLS (highest pressure level 46 hPa) using simple regression, This assimilation enables high-resolution daily maps of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone which is not possible from solar occultation measurements alone, such as from HALOE or Stratospheric Aerosols and Gas Experiment (SAGE), We also examine another new and promising technique that yields tropospheric column ozone directly from TOMS high-density footprint measurements in regions of high convective clouds. We define this method as the convective cloud differential (CCD) technique. The CCD method is shown to provide long time series (essentially late 1978 to the present) of tropospheric ozone in regions dominated by persistent high tropopause-level clouds; such as the maritime tropical Pacific and within or near midlatitude continental landmasses, In this our first study of the CCD and MLS/HALOE methods we limit analyses to tropical latitudes, Separation of stratospheric from tropospheric column ozone in the eastern Pacific tropics for January 1979 to December 1997 shows that the dominant interannual variability of stratospheric ozone is the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), whereas for tropospheric ozone it is driven by El Nino events. For validation purposes, both the CCD and assimilated UARS MLS/HALOE results are compared with ozonesonde data from several southern tropical stations. Despite all three measurements being distinctly different in sampling and technique, all three show good qualitative agreement.},

However, this type of volcanic activity is underreported and its global impact has been assessed only by model simulations constrained with very limited observations. First observations of the impact of high- latitude active volcanoes on marine boundary layer clouds are reported here. These observations were made using a combination of standard derived products and visible images from the MODIS, AMSR- E and GOES detectors. Two distinctive effects are identified. When there is an existing boundary layer cloud deck, an increase in cloud brightness and a decrease in both cloud effective radius and liquid water content were observed immediately downwind of the volcanoes. The visible appearance of these "volcano tracks” resembles the effect of man-made ship tracks. When synoptic conditions favor low cloudiness, the volcano plume ( or volcano cloud) increases significantly the cloud cover downwind. The volcano cloud can extend for hundreds of kilometers until mixing with background clouds. Unlike violent eruptions, the volcano clouds reported here ( the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific and the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic) have retrieved microphysical properties similar to those observed in ship tracks. However, when comparing the volcano clouds from these two regions, liquid water content can decrease, increase or remain unchanged with respect to nearby unperturbed clouds. These differences suggest that composition at the source, type of eruption and meteorological conditions influence the evolution of the cloud.},

The resulting change in the short-wave radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere was - 15 watts per square meter, comparable to the aerosol indirect effect over highly polluted regions. This observed impact of phytoplankton on clouds is attributed to changes in the size distribution and chemical composition of cloud condensation nuclei. We propose that secondary organic aerosol, formed from the oxidation of phytoplankton-produced isoprene, can affect chemical composition of marine cloud condensation nuclei and influence cloud droplet number. Model simulations support this hypothesis, indicating that 100\% of the observed changes in cloud properties can be attributed to the isoprene secondary organic aerosol.},

In this study, a composite analysis is performed for 32 monthly events of enhanced convection observed to the east of the Philippines. The composited monthly mean vorticity anomalies associated with the PJ pattern are elongated zonally with a distinct poleward tilt with height. This structure differs fundamentally from a combination of the first baroclinic mode in the tropics and the barotropic structure in midlatitudes, as has widely been accepted as a conceptual model of the PJ pattern. A wave-activity flux points polewards only in the lower troposphere, indicating that Rossby wave teleconnection occurs primarily through a low-level south-westerly jet. Those tilted anomalies over the western Pacific can effectively gain kinetic energy in the exits of the mean jet streams in the upper and lower troposphere and available potential energy (APE) in the presence of the vertically sheared jets. The enhanced convection can generate APE effectively, and the associated low-level anomalous circulation acts to increase moisture supply into the convective region while enhancing evaporation from the pre-warmed ocean surface. It is thus hypothesized that the PJ pattern may be regarded as a dynamical mode that can be effectively excited in the zonally asymmetric baroclinic mean flow associated with the Asian summer monsoon with an efficient self-sustaining mechanism through moist processes.},

For a given convective strength, small hydrometeors were more prevalent in the stratiform rain regions with dust than in those regions that were dust free. Evidence of abundant cloud ice particles in the dust sector, particularly at altitudes where heterogeneous nucleation of mineral dust prevails, further supports the observed changes of precipitation. The consequences of the microphysical effects of the dust aerosols were to shift the precipitation size spectrum from heavy precipitation to light precipitation and ultimately suppressing precipitation.},

	abstract = {This progress report on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) describes changes made to produce new cloud data products (D data), examines the evidence that these changes are improvements over the previous version (C data), summarizes some results, and discusses plans for the ISCCP through 2005. By late 1999 all datasets will be available for the period from July 1983 through December 1997. The most significant changes in the new D-series cloud datasets are 1) revised radiance calibrations to remove spurious changes in the long-term record, 2) increased cirrus detection sensitivity over land, 3) increased low-level cloud detection sensitivity in polar regions, 4) reduced biases in cirrus cloud properties using an ice crystal microphysics model in place of a liquid droplet microphysics model, and 5) increased detail about the variations of cloud properties. The ISCCP calibrations are now the most complete and self-consistent set of calibrations available for all the weather satellite imaging radiometers: total relative uncertainties in the radiance calibrations are estimated to be less than or similar to 5\% for visible and less than or similar to 2\% for infrared; absolute uncertainties are {\textless} 10\% and {\textless} 3\%, respectively. Biases in (detectable) cloud amounts have been reduced to less than or similar to 0.05, except in the summertime polar regions where the bias may still be similar to 0.10. Biases in cloud-top temperatures have been reduced to less than or similar to 2 K for lower-level clouds and less than or similar to 4 K for optically thin, upper-level clouds, except when they occur over lower-level clouds. Using Liquid and ice microphysics models reduces the biases in cloud optical thicknesses to less than or similar to 10\%, except in cases of mistaken phase identification; most of the remaining bias is caused by differences between actual and assumed cloud particle sizes and the small effects of cloud variations at scales {\textless} 5 km. Global mean cloud properties averaged over the period July 1983-June 1994 are the following: cloud amount = 0.675 +/- 0.012; cloud-top temperature = 261.5 +/- 2.8 K; and cloud optical thickness = 3.7 +/- 0.3, where the plus-minus values are the rms deviations of global monthly mean values from their long-term average. Long-term, seasonal, synoptic, and diurnal cloud variations are illustrated. The ISCCP dataset quantifies the variations of cloud properties at mesoscale resolution (3 h, 30 km) covering the whole globe for more than a decade, making it possible to study cloud system evolution over whole life cycles, watching interactions with the atmospheric general circulation. Plans for the next decade of the World Climate Research Programme require continuing global observations of clouds and the most practical way to fulfill this requirement is to continue ISCCP until it can be replaced by a more capable system with similar time resolutions and global coverage.},

However, present model-based estimates of this indirect forcing are highly uncertain. Satellite-based measurements would provide global or near-global coverage of this effect, but previous efforts to identify and quantify enhancement of cloud albedo caused by anthropogenic aerosols in satellite observations have been limited, largely because of strong dependence of albedo on cloud liquid water path (LWP), which is inherently highly variable. Here we examine satellite-derived cloud radiative properties over two 1-week episodes for which a chemical transport and transformation model indicates substantial influx of sulfate aerosol from industrial regions of Europe or North America to remote areas of the North Atlantic. Despite absence of discernible dependence of optical depth or albedo on modeled sulfate loading, examination of the dependence of these quantities on LWP readily permits detection and quantification of increases correlated with sulfate loading, which are otherwise masked by variability of LWP, demonstrating brightening of clouds because of the Twomey effect on a synoptic scale. Median cloud-top spherical albedo was enhanced over these episodes, relative to the unperturbed base case for the same LWP distribution, by 0.02 to 0.15.},

In this paper, citrus cloud properties derived from ground-based remote sensing data are compared with similar cloud properties derived from MODIS data on Terra. To improve the space-time correlation between the satellite and ground-based observations, data from a wind profiler are used to define the cloud advective streamline along which the comparisons are made. In this paper, approximately two dozen cases of cirrus are examined and a statistical approach to the comparison that relaxes the requirement that clouds occur over the ground-based instruments during the overpass instant is explored. The statistical comparison includes 168 cloudy MODIS overpasses of the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region and approximately 300 It of ground-based cirrus observations. The physical and radiative properties of cloud layers are derived from MODIS data separately by the MODIS Atmospheres Team and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Science Team using multiwavelength reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation measurements. Using two ground-based cloud property retrieval algorithms and the two MODIS algorithms, a positive correlation in the effective particle size, the optical thickness, the ice water path. and the cloud-top pressure between the various methods is shown, although sometimes there are significant biases. Classifying the clouds by optical thickness, it is demonstrated that the regionally averaged cloud properties derived from MODIS are similar to those diagnosed from the ground. Because of a conservative approach toward identifying thin cirrus pixels over this region, the area-averaged cloud properties derived from the MODIS Atmospheres MOD06 product tend to be biased slightly toward the optically thicker pixels. This bias tendency has implications for model validation and parameterization development applied to thin cirrus retrieved over SGP-like land surfaces. A persistent bias is also found in the derived cloud tops of thin cirrus with both satellite algorithms reporting cloud top several hundred meters less than that reported by the cloud radar. Overall, however, it is concluded that the MODIS retrieval algorithms characterize with reasonable accuracy the properties of thin cirrus over this region.},

The differences between the bulk optical properties of ice clouds used in collections 4 and 5 and the relevant impact on simulating the correlation of the bidirectional reflection functions at two MODIS bands centered at 0.65 (or 0.86) and 2.13 mu m are investigated. The level-3 MODIS ice cloud properties (specifically, ice cloud fraction, optical thickness, and effective particle size in this paper) from the collection 4 and 5 datasets; are compared for a tropical belt of 30 degrees S-30 degrees N. Furthermore, the impact of the differences between the MODIS collection 4 and 5 ice cloud products on the simulation of the radiative forcing of these clouds is investigated. Over the tropics, the averaged ice cloud fraction from collection 5 is 1. 1\% more than the collection 4 counterpart, the averaged optical thickness from collection 5 is 1.2 larger than the collection 4 counterpart, and the averaged effective particle radius from collection 5 is 1.8 mu m smaller than the collection 4 counterpart. Moreover, the magnitude of the differences between collection 5 and 4 ice cloud properties also depends on the surface characteristics, i.e., over land or over ocean. The differences of these two datasets (collections 4 and 5) of cloud properties can have a significant impact on the simulation of the radiative forcing of ice clouds. In terms of total (longwave plus shortwave) cloud radiative forcing, the differences between the collection, 5 and 4 results are distributed primarily between -60 and 20 W . m(-2) but peak at 0 W . m(-2).},

	abstract = {A new one-dimensional cloud model, specifically designed for application in mesoscale convective parameterization schemes (CPSs), is introduced. The model is unique in its representation of environmental entrainment and updraft detrainment rates. In particular, the two-way exchange of mass between clouds and their environment is modulated at each vertical level by a buoyancy sorting mechanism at the interface of clear and cloudy air. The new entrainment/detrainment scheme allows vertical profiles of both updraft moisture detrainment and updraft vertical mass flux to vary in a physically realistic way as a function of the cloud-scale environment. These performance characteristics allow the parameterized vertical distribution of convective heating and drying to be much more responsive to environmental conditions than is possible with a traditional one-dimensional entraining plume model.The sensitivities of the new model to variations in environmental convective available potential energy and vertical moisture distribution in idealized convective environments are demonstrated and its sensitivities to several key control parameters are examined. Finally, the performance of the new model in the Fritsch-Chappell CPS is evaluated. Parameterized heating and drying profiles are elucidated as they relate to the convective environment and to the type of cloud model used in the CPS.},

	abstract = {Time series of 1-Hz vertical velocity data collected during aircraft penetrations of oceanic cumulonimbus clouds over the western Pacific warm pool as part of the Equatorial Mesoscale Experiment (EMEX) are analyzed for updraft and downdraft events called cores. An updraft core is defined as occurring whenever the vertical velocity exceeds 1 m s(-1) for at least 500 m. A downdraft core is defined analogously. Over 19 000 km of straight and level flight legs are used in the analysis. Five hundred eleven updraft cores and 253 downdraft cores are included in the dataset.Core properties are summarized as distributions of average and maximum vertical velocity, diameter, and mass flux in four altitude intervals between 0.2 and 5.8 km. Distributions are approximately lognormal at all levels. Examination of the variation of the statistics with height suggests a maximum in vertical velocity between 2 and 3 km; slightly lower or equal vertical velocity is indicated at 5 km. Near the freezing level, virtual temperature deviations are found to be slightly positive for both updraft and downdraft cores. The excess in updraft cores is much smaller than that predicted by parcel theory.Comparisons with other studies that use the same analysis technique reveal that EMEX cores have approximately the same strength as cores of other oceanic areas, despite warmer sea surface temperatures. Diameter and mass flux are greater than those in GATE but smaller than those in hurricane rainbands. Oceanic cores are much weaker and appear to be slightly smaller than those observed over land during the Thunderstorm Project.The markedly weaker oceanic vertical velocities below 5.8 km (compared to the continental cores) cannot be attributed to smaller total convective available potential energy or to very high water loading. Rather, the authors suggest that water loading, although less than adiabatic, is more effective in reducing buoyancy of oceanic cores because of the smaller potential buoyancy below 5.8 km. Entrainment appears to be more effective in reducing buoyancy to well below adiabatic values in oceanic cores, a result consistent with the smaller oceanic core diameters in the lower cloud layer. It is speculated further that core diameters are related to boundary layer depth, which is clearly smaller over the oceans.},

	abstract = {Vertical motions in seven Atlantic hurricanes are determined from data recorded by Doppler radars on research aircraft. The database consists of Doppler velocities and reflectivities from vertically pointing radar rays collected along radial flight legs through the hurricane centers. The vertical motions are estimated throughout the depth of the troposphere from the Doppler velocities and bulk estimates of particle fallspeeds.Portions of the flight tracks are subjectively divided into eyewall, rainband, stratiform, and ”other” regions. Characteristics of the vertical velocity and radar structure are described as a function of altitude for the entire dataset and each of the four regions. Tn all of the regions, more than 70\% of the vertical velocities range from -2 to 2 m s(-1). The broadest distribution of vertical motion is in the eyewall region where similar to 5\% of the vertical motions are {\textgreater}5 m s(-1). Averaged over the entire dataset, the mean vertical velocity is upward at altitudes. Mean downward motion occurs only in the lower troposphere of the stratiform region. Significant vertical variations in the mean profiles of vertical velocity and reflectivity are discussed and related to microphysical processes.In the lower and middle troposphere, the characteristics of the Doppler-derived vertical motions are similar to those described in an earlier study using flight-level vertical velocities, even though the horizontal resolution of the Doppler data is similar to 750 m compared to similar to 125 m from the in situ flight-level measurements. The Doppler data are available at higher altitudes than those reached by turboprop aircraft and provide information oil vertical as well as horizontal variations. In a vertical plane along the radial flight tracks, Doppler up- and downdrafts are defined at each 300-m altitude interval as vertical Velocities whose absolute Values continuously exceed 1.5 m s(-1), with at least one speed having an absolute value greater than 3.0 m s(-1). The properties of the Doppler drafts are lognormally distributed. In each of the regions, updrafts outnumber downdrafts by at least a factor of 2 and updrafts are wider and stronger than downdrafts. Updrafts in the eyewall slope radially outward with height and are significantly correlated over larger radial and vertical extents than in the other three regions. If the downwind (tangential) slope with height of updrafts varies little among the regions, updrafts capable of transporting air with relatively large moist static energy from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere are primarily in the eyewall region. Downdrafts affect a smaller vertical and horizontal area than updrafts and have no apparent radial slope.The total upward or downward mass flux is defined as the flux produced by all of the upward or downward Doppler vertical velocities. The maximum upward mass flux in all but the ”other” region is near 1-km altitude, an indication that boundary-layer convergence is efficient in producing upward motion. Above the sea surface, the downward mass flux decreases with altitude. At every altitude, the total net mass flux is upward, except for the lower troposphere in the stratiform region where it is downward. Doppler-derived up- and downdrafts are a subset of the vertical velocity field that occupy small fractions of the total area, yet they contribute a substantial fraction to the total mass flux, In the eyewall and rainband regions, for example, the Doppler updrafts cover less than 30\% of the area but are responsible for {\textgreater}75\% and {\textgreater}50\% to the total upward mass flux, respectively. The Doppler downdrafts typically encompass less than 10\% of the area yet provide similar to 50\% of the total downward mass flux in the eyewall and similar to 20\% of the total downward Aux in the rainband, stratiform, and ”other” regions.},

	abstract = {We analyze the properties of deep convection over the equatorial Pacific and its relationship to sea surface temperature (SST) and surface wind divergence using ISCCP radiance data for July 1983 and January 1984. Deep convective clouds (DCC) are diagnosed with both a combined visible-infrared threshold method and an infrared-only threshold method. The visible channel is important in diagnosing deep convection in different regions with different surface and atmospheric properties because of the existence of large-scale variations of DCC top altitudes.The ITCZ and SPCZ exhibit changes in these two months that are characteristic of both the El Nino and seasonal cycles. Deep convection is latitudinally confined to a much smaller spatial scale than that suggested by maps of outgoing longwave radiation. Diurnal variations of DCC cover and associated mesoscale cirrus/anvil cloud (CAC) cover are out of phase, with deep convection peaking in the early morning throughout the equatorial Pacific. The diurnal cycle is strongest in the west Pacific and Indonesia, where deep convection is most intense. DCC top temperatures are at a minimum several hours before the maximum in DCC cover and out of phase with CAC top temperatures.Two types of relationships between deep convection, SST, and surface wind convergence are suggested: 1) When a large area within a region is covered by SSTs greater than 28-degrees-C, deep convection is enhanced in areas where SST exceeds 28-degrees-C in the absence of strong surface divergence. Strong monthly mean surface convergence does not enhance deep convection in this case. 2) When the warmest SSTs in a region are less than about 28-degrees-C, deep convection is significantly enhanced by strong surface wind convergence near the local maximum in SST (26-degrees-28-degrees). An analysis of a slightly different version of the ISCCP data for the period July 1983-July 1985 suggests that the first type of relationship is the typical situation in the west Pacific, while the second relationship is most obvious in non-El Nino northern winters in the east Pacific. DCC top height generally increases as SST increases, but the visible reflectance of DCC does not vary strongly with SST.},

	abstract = {Cloud size distributions of shallow cumulus cloud populations are calculated using the large-eddy simulation (LES) approach. A range of different cases is simulated, and the results are compared to observations of real cloud populations. Accordingly, the same algorithm is applied as in observational studies using high-altitude photography or remote sensing.The cloud size density of the simulated cloud populations is described well by a power law at the smaller sizes. This scaling covers roughly one order of magnitude of cloud sizes, with a power-law exponent of -1.70, which is comparable to exponents found in observational studies. A sensitivity test for the resolution suggests that the scaling continues at sizes smaller than the standard grid spacing. In contrast, on the other end, the scaling region is bounded by a distinct scale break. When the cloud size is nondimensionalized by the scale break size, the cloud size densities of all cases collapse. This corroborates the idea of a universal description for the whole cloud size density, with the scale break size as the only variable. The intermediate dominating size in the cloud fraction and mass flux decompositions is directly related to the presence of the scale break in the cloud size density. Despite their large number, the smallest clouds contribute very little to the total vertical mass transport. The intermediate size of the dominating clouds in the cloud fraction and mass flux is insensitive to the resolution of LES.},

Here, satellite radar observations are used to produce a composite picture of the life cycle of convection in these two regions. Estimates of the broadband thermal flux from the geostationary Meteosat-8 satellite are used to identify and track organized convective systems over their life cycle. The evolution of the system size and vertical extent are used to define five life cycle stages ( warm and cold developing, mature, cold and warm dissipating), providing the basis for the composite analysis of the system evolution. The tracked systems are matched to overpasses of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, and a composite picture of the evolution of various radar and lightning characteristics is built up.The results suggest a fundamental difference in the convective life cycle between land and ocean. African storms evolve from convectively active systems with frequent lightning in their developing stages to more stratiform conditions as they dissipate. Over the Atlantic, the convective fraction remains essentially constant into the dissipating stages, and lightning occurrence peaks late in the life cycle. This behavior is consistent with differences in convective sustainability in land and ocean regions as proposed in previous studies.The area expansion rate during the developing stages of convection is used to provide an estimate of the intensity of convection. Reasonable correlations are found between this index and the convective system lifetime, size, and depth.},

	abstract = {Average ice crystal size distributions are parameterized as functions of temperature and ice water content (IWC), based on observations in cirrus produced as outflows of deep convection made during the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX), as the sum of a first-order gamma function, describing ice crystals with melted equivalent diameters (D-m) less than 100 mu m, and a lognormal function, describing larger ice crystals. The fit parameters are chosen to minimize the chi-squared function describing the difference between observed and parameterized distribution functions. The parameterization is mass conserving, accurately represents small ice crystals, and is easily integrable.The parameterization gives accurate estimates of mass, area, and number contained in different size ranges. The radiative properties estimated from midlatitude parameterizations are compared with those estimated from this parameterization using anomalous diffraction theory. As opposed to some previous studies, small crystals do not dominate the mass and radiative properties bf cirrus. Comparison with midlatitude observations shows that size distribution shape can vary substantially depending on where, when, and how the cirrus is measured and on how it forms.},

	abstract = {In situ microphysical measurements of three anvils were made 17 March, 1 April, and 4 April 1993 during the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment for several constant altitude penetrations, in the same direction or opposite the ambient wind, from 7 to 14 km. Ice water contents (IWCs), derived from an optical array probe, increased downward in the anvil; concentrations also increased, but not as quickly. Median mass dimensions, defined as the ice crystal maximum dimension below which half of the mass is contained, increased from averages of less than 0.1 mm near the tops to averages of about 0.5 mm near the bases. Substantial variations in cloud parameters occurred in the horizontal direction as well, with larger IWCs and concentrations closer to the convective core and its remnants.Small crystals were measured and categorized according to their shapes with the Video Ice Particle Sampler, which detects particles with dimensions greater than 5 mu m. For small IWCs, especially prevalent at cloud tops, small crystals make substantial, but variable, contributions to the total IWC and cross-sectional area A(c). Since A(c), closely related to cloud radiative properties, is at least one order of magnitude larger near the base of the cloud than near the top, it is suggested that larger particles near the bottom of thick anvils or near intense convective cores may be as important in determining radiative properties as the smaller crystals near the top.A wide variety of particle habits was seen. Many smaller crystals had unidentifiable circular images that differed from midlatitude cirrus, where columns dominate the small crystal population. Large crystals observed with the optical probes were typically complex and compact spatial crystals or aggregates in high IWC regions; this contrasts with the bullet rosettes commonly found in midlatitude cirrus produced by widespread ascent.},

	abstract = {Global satellite data are used to infer the droplet number concentration of marine boundary layer clouds. In a first step, two and a half years (July 2002 to December 2004) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, on board NASA's Aqua satellite) level 3 data estimates of cloud effective radius and optical thickness are used to derive cloud droplet number concentration N and cloud geometrical thickness H under the assumption of adiabatically stratified clouds. Theoretical error estimates show that for a liquid water path higher than 30 g/m(2) and a cloud fraction higher than 0.8, H (N) can be derived with a relative uncertainty of better than 20\% (80\%). To further validate the estimates of N and H, cloud liquid water path is calculated and compared to independent observations of cloud liquid water path from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), also on board Aqua. Good agreement between the two different data sets is found. In a second step, the global distribution of cloud droplet number concentration in stratiform boundary layer clouds is evaluated. The data are separated into observations that are likely to be drizzling and drizzle- free using published relations between drizzle rate and N and H. It is found that the mean droplet number concentration over remote Northern Hemisphere oceans is higher than over the southern oceans (64-89 cm(-3) in the Northern Hemisphere and 40-67 cm(-3) in the Southern Hemisphere). Leeward of the major continents cloud droplet number concentration is generally high with maximum values close to the coasts. On the Southern Hemisphere, especially over the east Pacific Ocean, microphysical conditions were almost constant through the entire observation period. Over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, the cloud microphysical variability appears to be strongly influenced by the dry biomass burning season in Africa.},

But although the forecasting of hurricane tracks has improved over the past 30 years, the factors that control the intensity of hurricanes are still poorly understood, leading to almost no reliability in forecasts of hurricane intensity evolution. Efforts to improve intensity forecasts have focused almost exclusively on characterizing the dynamical interactions between hurricanes and their atmospheric environment. Here I use a simple numerical model to demonstrate that, in most cases, the evolution of hurricane intensity depends mainly on three factors: the storm's initial intensity, the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere through which it moves, and the heat exchange with the upper layer of the ocean under the core of the hurricane, Such a limited number of controlling factors offers hope that, given an accurate forecast of a hurricane's track, its intensity can be reliably forecast using very simple models.},

At temperatures lower than 202 kelvin, RHi values show a sharp increase to average values of over 130\% in both cloud types. These enhanced RHi values are attributed to the presence of a new class of HNO3-containing ice particles (Delta-ice). We propose that surface HNO3 molecules prevent the ice/vapor system from reaching equilibrium by a mechanism similar to that of freezing point depression by antifreeze proteins. Delta-ice represents a new link between global climate and natural and anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emissions. Including Delta-ice in climate models will alter simulated cirrus properties and the distribution of upper tropospheric water vapor.},

This is an extension of earlier work that focused on modeling the ABL for 31 May 1978 at Cabauw, Netherlands; previously, it was found that coupled land atmosphere tests using a simple land surface scheme did not accurately represent surface fluxes and coupled ABL development. Here, findings from that earlier study on ABL parameterization are utilized, and include a more sophisticated land surface scheme. This land surface scheme allows the land-atmosphere system to respond interactively with the ABL. Results indicate that in coupled land-atmosphere model runs, realistic daytime surface fluxes and atmospheric profiles are produced, even in the presence of ABL clouds (shallow cumulus). Subsequently, the role of soil moisture in the development of ABL clouds is explored in terms of a new relative humidity tendency equation at the ABL top where a number of processes and interactions are involved. Among other issues, it is shown that decreasing soil moisture may actually lead to an increase in ABL clouds in some cases.},

Nucleation of ice resulting from cooling was simulated for a range of aerosol number densities, initial temperatures, and cooling rates. In contrast to observations of stratus clouds, we find that the number of ice crystals that nucleate in cirrus is relatively insensitive to the number of aerosols present. The ice crystal size distribution at the end of the nucleation process is unaffected by the assumed initial aerosol number density. Essentially, nucleation continues until enough ice crystals are present such that their deposition growth rapidly depletes the vapor and shuts off any further nucleation. However, the number of ice crystals nucleated increases rapidly with decreasing initial temperature and increasing cooling rate. This temperature dependence alone could explain the large ice crystal number density observed in very cold tropical cirrus.},

Reflectivity to rain rate (Z-R) relationships are determined from shipboard raindrop-size distribution measurements obtained from observations using filter-paper, and compared to Z-R relationships derived from aircraft probe data from below north-east Atlantic drizzling Sc and stratus. A model for the evaporation and sedimentation of drizzle is combined with reflectivity profiles from a millimetre-wavelength cloud radar to derive information on the mean raindrop radius and drizzle drop concentrations at cloud base, and to show how Z-R relationships change with height below the cloud base. The Z-R relationships are used in conjunction with shipborne C-band radar reflectivity data to estimate areal average precipitation with uncertainties at cloud base and at the surface. In the Sc drizzle Z-R relationship, Z = aR(b) (where a and b are constants), the estimated exponent b = 1.1 to 1.4 is lower than commonly observed in deep convective rain (b = 1.5). Analyses indicate that variations in Sc rain rates and reflectivities are influenced both by fluctuations in drizzle drop concentration and in mean radius, but that number concentration contributes more to the modulation of rain rate in Sc. Rain rates derived using the scanning C-band radar are found to be spatially variable, with much of the accumulation originating from a small fraction of the drizzling area. The observations also suggest that rain rate in marine Sc is strongly dependent on cloud liquid-water path, and inversely correlated with cloud droplet concentration.},

Three-dimensional streamlines strongly suggests connections between the characteristics of the ozone monthly mean vertical profiles, the most persistent circulation patterns in the troposphere over Equatorial Africa ( on a monthly basis) such as the Harmattan, the African Easterly Jet, the Trades and the regions of ozone precursors emissions by biomass burning. During the biomass burning season in each hemisphere, the lower troposphere exhibits layers of enhanced ozone (i.e. 70 ppbv over the coast of Gulf of Guinea in December-February and 85 ppbv over Congo in June-August). The characteristics of the ozone monthly mean vertical profiles are clearly connected to the regional flow regime determined by seasonal dynamic forcing. The mean ozone profile over the coast of Gulf of Guinea in the burning season is characterized by systematically high ozone below 650 hPa; these are due to the transport by the Harmattan and the AEJ of the pollutants originating from upwind fires. The confinement of high ozone to the lower troposphere is due to the high stability of the Harmattan and the blocking Saharan anticyclone which prevents efficient vertical mixing. In contrast, ozone enhancements observed over Central Africa during the local dry season (June-August) are not only found in the lower troposphere but throughout the troposphere. Moreover, this study highlights a connection between the regions of the coast of Gulf of Guinea and regions of Congo to the south that appears on a semi annual basis. Vertical profiles in wet-season regions exhibit ozone enhancements in the lower troposphere due to biomass burning products transport from fires situated in the opposite dry-season hemisphere.},

	abstract = {The effects of aerosol on warm trade cumulus clouds are investigated using a large-eddy simulation with size-resolved cloud microphysics. It is shown that, as expected, increases in aerosols cause a reduction in precipitation and an increase in the cloud-averaged liquid water path (LWP). However, for the case under study, cloud fraction, cloud size, cloud-top height, and depth decrease in response to increasing aerosol concentration, contrary to accepted hypotheses associated with the second aerosol indirect effect. It is found that the complex responses of clouds to aerosols are determined by competing effects of precipitation and droplet evaporation associated with entrainment. As aerosol concentration increases, precipitation suppression tends to maintain the clouds and lead to higher cloud LWP, whereas cloud droplets become smaller and evaporate more readily, which tends to dissipate the clouds and leads to lower cloud fraction, cloud size, and depth. An additional set of experiments with higher surface latent heat flux, and hence higher LWP and drizzle rate, was also performed. Changes in cloud properties due to aerosols have the same trends as in the base runs, although the magnitudes of the changes are larger. Evidence for significant stabilization (or destabilization) of the subeloud layer due to drizzle is not found, mainly because drizzling clouds cover only a small fraction of the domain. It is suggested that cloud fraction may only increase with increasing aerosol loading for larger clouds that are less susceptible to entrainment and evaporation. Finally, it is noted that at any given aerosol concentration the dynamical variability in bulk cloud parameters such as LWP tends to be larger than the aerosol-induced changes in these parameters, indicating that the second aerosol indirect effect may be hard to measure in this cloud type. The variability in cloud optical depth is, however, dominated by changes in aerosol, rather than dynamics.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of trade wind cumulus clouds are conducted for clean and polluted aerosol conditions and at a number of different grid sizes to explore (1) the microphysical and morphological responses of fields of cumulus to aerosol perturbations and (2) the robustness of these responses to resolution. Cloud size distributions are shown to be well approximated by a negative power law function indicating that as resolution increases, more and more small clouds are resolved. Cloud fraction in the highest-resolution simulations is 30\% higher than in the coarse-resolution simulations. Polluted cloud populations contain higher numbers of smaller clouds than clean cloud populations. Their frequency of convection is higher and lifetimes are shorter. The polluted clouds also tend to have higher cloud-averaged liquid water contents. It is hypothesized that these responses are a result of a chain reaction set off by stronger evaporation at cloud edges in the case of polluted clouds. In all cases, the smallest clouds either dominate or contribute significantly to cloud fraction and cloud reflectance, in accord with recent satellite studies. The response of cloud fraction and liquid water path to aerosol changes is shown to be strongly dependent on the definition of what constitutes a 'cloud,” suggesting that caution be exercised before parameterizing these responses.},

	abstract = {[1] During the July 2002 CRYSTAL-FACE field program based from Key West, Florida, aircraft measurements showed that long-lived thin tropopause cirrus (TTC) layers were often present above thunderstorm anvils. This paper describes these clouds and explores their possible origins. Measurements showed that the horizontal dimensions of TTC layers were nearly identical to convectively formed anvils beneath, but that TTC did not appear to have originated from convective detrainment. Rather, they appeared to have formed in stably stratified air derived from high altitudes near the tropopause. TTC were separated vertically from the top of the anvil by similar to1 km, they lacked precipitation particles, and they were strongly depleted in HDO, all of which indicate in situ formation. However, compared to surrounding clear air near the tropopause, TTC were enriched in moisture and trace gases. The degree of enrichment was consistent with mixing of air near the tropopause with the same convective air mass that produced the anvil. Unlike surrounding air, TTC had embedded a monochromatic gravity wave with a wavelength of 2 km and an amplitude of several hundred meters. This evidence, supported by a photograph from CRYSTAL-FACE, leads to the conjecture that TTC originate as stratiform pileus clouds that form near the tropopause ahead of vigorous convective uplift. We hypothesize that the pileus are penetrated by the convection, moistened through turbulent mixing, and once the convection subsides, they are sustained by radiative cooling due to the presence of the anvil layer beneath.},

The size distribution, shapes, and spatial distribution of cumulus clouds were examined with ASTER near-infrared data at 15 m resolution. The height distribution of these cumulus clouds was derived from ASTER thermal infrared data at 90 m resolution. The size distribution of cumuli exhibited a power law form and an exponent of 2.19 with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 using a direct power law fit method. The total cloud fraction of trade wind cumulus was 0.086, half of which was contributed from clouds smaller than 2 km in equivalent area diameter. An area-perimeter power law was observed with a dimension of 1.28 and a correlation coefficient of 0.87. The majority of cloudy pixels had cloud top altitudes around 1 km and increasing altitude with increasing cloud equivalent area diameter. Seventy-five percent of clouds have a nearest neighbor within a distance of 10 times their area-equivalent radius. Our results are compared to other studies of small cumulus taken over different parts of the world observed using different instruments. The statistics of cumuli observed in this study are poorly related to synoptic scale meteorological conditions from reanalysis data.},

Within ACCENT, a European Network of Excellence, ozone changes between 1850 and 2000 are assessed for the troposphere and the lower stratosphere ( up to 30 km) by a variety of seven chemistry-climate models and three chemical transport models. The modeled ozone changes are taken as input for detailed calculations of radiative forcing.When only changes in chemistry are considered ( constant climate) the modeled global-mean tropospheric ozone column increase since preindustrial times ranges from 7.9 DU to 13.8 DU among the ten participating models, while the stratospheric column reduction lies between 14.1 DU and 28.6 DU in the models considering stratospheric chemistry. The resulting radiative forcing is strongly dependent on the location and altitude of the modeled ozone change and varies between 0.25 Wm(-2) and 0.45 Wm(-2) due to ozone change in the troposphere and - 0.123 Wm(-2) and + 0.066 Wm(-2) due to the stratospheric ozone change.Changes in ozone and other greenhouse gases since preindustrial times have altered climate. Six out of the ten participating models have performed an additional calculation taking into account both chemical and climate change. In most models the isolated effect of climate change is an enhancement of the tropospheric ozone column increase, while the stratospheric reduction becomes slightly less severe. In the three climate-chemistry models with detailed tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry the inclusion of climate change increases the resulting radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone change by up to 0.10 Wm(-2), while the radiative forcing due to stratospheric ozone change is reduced by up to 0.034 Wm(-2).Considering tropospheric and stratospheric change combined, the total ozone column change is negative while the resulting net radiative forcing is positive.},

The time evolution of clouds is defined through the large-scale budget equations for cloud water content and cloud air (which is converted into a prognostic equation for fractional cloud cover). The scheme considers the formation of clouds in connection with large-scale ascent, diabatic cooling, boundary-layer turbulence, and horizontal transport of cloud water from convective updrafts. Clouds dissipate through adiabatic and diabatic turbulent mixing of cloud air with unsaturated environmental air, and depletion of cloud water by precipitation.The scheme differs from conventional schemes in its approach, which is fully prognostic and model consistent, and in the larger degree of complexity as the formation of anvil and cirrus clouds originating by cumulus updrafts and boundary-layer clouds is included.The scheme has been tested-in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global forecast model and compared with the ECMWF operational cloud scheme. The results show that realistic cloud fields are produced when compared to observed values of cloud cover and cloud water content. The representation of cloud processes in connection with anvil clouds is shown to have a strong effect on the hydrological cycle and the maintenance of the tropospheric water vapor content.},

Here, we present an idealized study of the climate response to deliberately seeding large-scale stratocumulus cloud decks in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and South Atlantic, thereby inducing cooling via aerosol indirect effects. Atmosphere-only, atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean, and fully coupled atmosphere/ocean versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model are used to investigate the radiative forcing, climate efficacy, and regional response of temperature, precipitation, and net primary productivity to such geoengineering. The radiative forcing simulations indicate that, for our parameterization of aerosol indirect effects, up to 35\% of the radiative forcing due to current levels of greenhouse gases could be offset by stratocumulus modification. Equilibrium simulations with the atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean model, wherein each of the three stratocumulus sheets is modified in turn, reveal that the most efficient cooling per unit radiative forcing occurs when the South Pacific stratocumulus sheet is modified. Transient coupled model simulations suggest that geoengineering all three stratocumulus areas delays the simulated global warming by about 25 years. These simulations also indicate that, while some areas experience increases in precipitation and net primary productivity, sharp decreases are simulated in South America, with particularly detrimental impacts on the Amazon rain forest. These results show that, while some areas benefit from geoengineering, there are significant areas where the response could be very detrimental with implications for the practical applicability of such a scheme.},

In this contribution, we address three climate engineering schemes that have been proposed. One scheme attempts to reduce the incoming solar radiation far outside the atmosphere, the other two increase the earth albedo either by introducing aerosols into the stratosphere or by modifying clouds in the lower marine atmosphere. While all three schemes face severe engineering challenges, they are in principle able to bring the global energy budget back toward the preindustrial value. However, this only holds for the global average, while unintentional regional climate response must be expected. The regional response is hardly predictable, and it is even rather difficult to detect in view of climatic variability. On the other hand, climate engineering would have severe ecological, societal, legal and political implications. We conclude that none of the schemes offers itself as remedy for climate change, but argue that dedicated research on their potential and consequences is advisable.},

This paper focuses on scientific and meteorological aspects of the scheme. Associated technological issues are addressed in a companion paper.Analytical calculations, cloud modelling and (particularly) GCM computations suggest that, if outstanding questions are satisfactorily resolved, the controllable, globally averaged negative forcing resulting from deployment of this scheme might be sufficient to balance the positive forcing associated with a doubling of CO2 concentration. This statement is supported quantitatively by recent observational evidence from three disparate sources. We conclude that this technique could thus be adequate to hold the Earth's temperature constant for many decades.More work - especially assessments of possible meteorological and climatological rami. cations - is required on several components of the scheme, which possesses the advantages that (i) it is ecologically benign - the only raw materials being wind and seawater, (ii) the degree of cooling could be controlled, and (iii) if unforeseen adverse effects occur, the system could be immediately switched off, with the forcing returning to normal within a few days (although the response would take a much longer time).},

Results indicate that the radiation budget changes are caused by changes in tropical mean cloudiness.

	abstract = {Aerosol impacts on climate change are still poorly understood, in part, because the few observations and methods for detecting their effects are not well established. For the first time, the enhancement in cloud albedo is directly measured on a cloud-by-cloud basis and linked to increasing aerosol concentrations by using multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles to simultaneously observe the cloud microphysics, vertical aerosol distribution, and associated solar radiative fluxes. In the presence of long-range transport of dust and anthropogenic pollution, the trade cumuli have higher droplet concentrations and are on average brighter. Our observations suggest a higher sensitivity of radiative forcing by trade cumuli to increases in cloud droplet concentrations. than previously reported owing to a constrained droplet radius such that increases in droplet concentrations also increase cloud liquid water content. This aerosol-cloud forcing efficiency is as much as -60 W m(-2) per 100\% percent cloud fraction for a doubling of droplet concentrations and associated increase of liquid water content. Finally, we develop a strategy for detecting aerosol-cloud interactions based on a nondimensional scaling analysis that relates the contribution of single clouds to albedo measurements and illustrates the significance of characterizing cloud morphology in resolving radiometric measurements. This study demonstrates that aerosol-cloud-albedo interactions can be directly observed by simultaneous observations below, in, and above the clouds.},

The 10-day simulations use an idealized Lagrangian trajectory representative of summertime climatological conditions in the subtropical northeastern Pacific. The sea surface temperature is increased steadily at 1.5 K day(-1), reflecting the southwestward advection of the subtropical marine boundary layer by the trade winds, while the free tropospheric temperature remains unchanged. Results from simulations with both a fixed diurnally averaged shortwave radiative forcing and diurnally varying shortwave forcing are presented.A two-stage model for the boundary layer evolution consistent with these simulations is proposed. In the first stage, decoupling is induced by increased latent heat fluxes in the deepening boundary layer. After decoupling, cloud cover remains high, but the cloudiness regime changes from a single stratocumulus layer to sporadic cumulus that detrain into stratocumulus clouds. In the second stage, farther SST increase causes the cumuli to become deeper and more vigorous, penetrating farther into the inversion and entraining more and more dry above-inversion air. This evaporates liquid water in cumulus updrafts before they detrain, causing the eventual dissipation of the overlying stratocumulus. Diurnal variations of insolation lead to a large daytime reduction in stratocumulus cloud amount, but they have little impact on the systematic evolution of boundary layer structure and cloud. The simulated cloudiness changes are not consistent with existing criteria for cloud-top entrainment instability.},

	abstract = {Currently available satellite data can be used to track the response of clouds and humidity to intense precipitation events. A compositing technique centered in space and time on locations experiencing high rain rates is used to detail the characteristic evolution of several quantities measured from a suite of satellite instruments. Intense precipitation events in the convective tropics are preceded by an increase in low-level humidity. Optically thick cold clouds accompany the precipitation burst, which is followed by the development of spreading upper-level anvil clouds and an increase in upper-tropospheric humidity over a broader region than that occupied by the precipitation anomalies. The temporal separation between the convective event and the development of anvil clouds is about 3 h. The humidity increase at upper levels and the associated decrease in clear-sky longwave emission persist for many hours after the convective event. Largescale vertical motions from reanalysis show a coherent evolution associated with precipitation events identified in an independent dataset: precipitation events begin with stronger upward motion anomalies in the lower troposphere, which then evolve toward stronger upward motion anomalies in the upper troposphere, in conjunction with the development of anvil clouds. Greater upper-tropospheric moistening and cloudiness are associated with larger-scale and better-organized convective systems, but even weaker, more isolated systems produce sustained upper-level humidity and clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation anomalies.},

	abstract = {Observational evidence is presented to show a teleconnection between the central Pacific and East Asia during the extreme phases of ENSO cycles. This Pacific-East Asian teleconnection is confined to the lower troposphere. The key system that bridges the warm (cold) events in the eastern Pacific and the weak (strong) East Asian winter monsoons is an anomalous lower-tropospheric anticyclone (cyclone) located in the western North Pacific. The western North Pacific wind anomalies develop rapidly in late fall of the year when a strong warm or cold event matures. The anomalies persist until the following spring or early summer, causing anomalously wet (dry) conditions along the East Asian polar front stretching from southern China northeastward to the east of Japan (Kuroshio extension).Using atmospheric general circulation and intermediate models, the authors show that the anomalous Philippine Sea anticyclone results from a Rossby-wave response to suppressed convective heating, which is induced by both the in situ ocean surface cooling and the subsidence forced remotely by the central Pacific warming. The development of the anticyclone is nearly concurrent with the enhancement of the local sea surface cooling. Both the anticyclone and the cooling region propagate slowly eastward. The development and persistence of the teleconnection is primarily attributed to a positive thermodynamic feedback between the anticyclone and the sea surface cooling in the presence of mean northeasterly trades. The rapid establishment of the Philippine Sea wind and SST anomalies implies the occurrence of extratropical-tropical interactions through cold surge-induced exchanges of surface buoyancy flux. The central Pacific warming plays an essential role in the development of the western Pacific cooling and the wind anomalies by setting up a favorable environment for the anticyclone-SST interaction and midlatitude-tropical interaction in the western North Pacific.},

By analyzing temporal changes in the frequency of occurrence of emitted thermal and reflected solar fluxes, the effects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation are minimized, and an independent longer-time-scale variation of the radiation budget is identified.

The method indicates that in many models there is a significant rapid tropospheric adjustment to CO2 leading to changes in cloud, and reducing the effective radiative forcing, in a way analogous to the indirect and semidirect effects of aerosol. By contrast, in most models the cloud feedback is small, defined as the part of the change that evolves with Delta T. Comparison with forcing evaluated by fixing sea surface conditions gives qualitatively similar results for the cloud components of forcing, both globally and locally.

Here we evaluate the aerosol effect on clouds, using large statistics of daily satellite data over the North Atlantic Ocean. We found a strong correlation between the presence of aerosols and the structural properties of convective clouds. These correlations suggest systematic invigoration of convective clouds by pollution, desert dust and biomass burning aerosols. On average increase in the aerosol concentration from a baseline to the average values is associated with a 0.05 +/- 0.01 increase in the cloud fraction and a 40 +/- 5mb decrease in the cloud top pressure.},

We present the changes in tropospheric ozone and its precursors (CH4, NMHCs, CO, NOx) since the preindustrial period. The ozone change at the surface exhibits a maximum increase at midlatitudes in the northern hemisphere reaching more than a factor of 3 over Europe,North America, and Southeast Asia during summer. The calculated preindustrial ozone levels are particularly sensitive to assumptions about natural and biomass burning emissions of precursors. The possible future evolution of ozone to the year 2050 is also simulated, using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IS92a scenario to estimate the global and geographical changes in surface emissions. The future evolution of ozone stresses the important role played by the tropics and the subtropics. In this case a maximum ozone increase is calculated in the northern subtropical region and is associated with increased emissions in Southeast Asia and Central America. The ozone future evolution also affects the more remote regions of the troposphere, and an increase of 10-20\% in background ozone levels is calculated over marine regions in the southern hemisphere. Our best estimate of the global and annual mean radiative forcing associated with tropospheric ozone increase since the preindustrial era is 0.43 W m(-2). This value represents about 20\% of the forcing associated with well-mixed greenhouse gases. The normalized tropospheric ozone radiative forcing is 0.048 W m(-2) DU-1. An upper estimate on our forcing of 0.77 W m(-2) is calculated when a stratospheric tracer is used to approximate background ozone levels. In 2050 an additional ozone forcing of 0.26 W m(-2) is calculated, providing a forcing from preindustrial to 2050 of 0.69 W m(-2).},

	abstract = {TROPOSPHERIC aerosols are thought to have three important effects on the Earth's radiation budget: the direct radiative effect(1) (perturbation of clear-sky reflectivity), the indirect radiative effect(2) (modification of cloud albedo) and the effect on the hydrological cycle(3) (modification of the vertical thickness and horizontal extent of clouds). The first two effects have been understood in principle for nearly 20 years, and quantitative estimates of their magnitudes have been provided by models and observations(4). The third phenomenon, and its relation to the other two, has received far less attention. Previous work(3) has shown, however, that increases in aerosol concentration may act to increase cloud albedo by increasing horizontal cloud fraction as well as cloud reflectivity. Here we use a simple model of the marine cloud-topped boundary layer to investigate the changes in cloud thickness and albedo that result from changes in precipitation as particle concentrations vary. We find that the sensitivity of layer cloud albedo to droplet number concentration (the albedo susceptibility) is increased by 50-200\% when the dependence of cloud thickness on particle number is included. The results suggest that the response of cloud thickness to changes in aerosol particle concentration must be taken into account for accurate prediction of global albedo by climate models.},

	abstract = {Applying perturbation theory within a mixed layer framework, the response of the marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud thickness h to imposed increases of the cloud droplet concentration N-d as a surrogate for increases in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations is examined. An analytical formulation is used to quantify the response and demonstrate theoretically that for the range of environmental conditions found over the subtropical eastern oceans, on time scales of less than a day, the cloud thickness feedback response is largely determined by a balance between the moistening/cooling of the MBL resulting from the suppression of surface precipitation, and the drying/warming resulting from enhanced entrainment resulting from increased turbulent kinetic energy. Quantifying the transient cloud response as a ratio of the second to the first indirect effects demonstrates that the nature of the feedback is critically dependent upon the nature of the unperturbed state, with the cloud-base height z(cb), being the single most important determinant. For z(cb) {\textless} 400 m, increasing N-d leads to cloud thickening in accordance with the Albrecht hypothesis. However, for z(cb) {\textgreater} 400 m, cloud thinning occurs, which results in a feedback effect that increasingly cancels the Twomey effect as z(cb) increases. The environmental conditions favoring an elevated cloud base are relatively weak lower-tropospheric stability and a dry free troposphere, although the former is probably more important over the subtropical eastern oceans. On longer time scales an invariable thickening response is found, and thus accurate quantification of the aerosol indirect effects will require a good understanding of the processes that control the time scale over which aerosol perturbations are modified.},

It is derived from Grenier and Bretherton but has been heavily modified to improve its numerical stability and efficiency with the long time steps used in climate models. A goal was to provide a more physically realistic treatment of marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layers than in the current CAM.Key features of the scheme include use of moist-conserved variables, an explicit entrainment closure for convective layers, diagnosis of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) for computation of turbulent diffusivities, an efficient new formulation of TKE transport as a relaxation to layer-mean TKE, and unified treatment of all turbulent layers in each atmospheric column.The scheme is compared with the default turbulence parameterizations in the CAM using three single-column modeling cases, using both operational and high vertical and time resolution. Both schemes performed comparably well on the dry convective boundary layer case. For a stable boundary layer case, the default CAM overdeepens the boundary layer unless its free-tropospheric mixing length is greatly reduced, whereupon the new scheme and default CAM again both perform well at both tested resolutions. A nocturnal stratocumulus case was much better simulated by the new scheme than the default CAM, with much less resolution sensitivity. Global climate simulations with the new scheme in tandem with a new shallow cumulus parameterization are presented in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {A new refinement of Albrecht et al.'s bulk model for shallow-cumulus convection is presented. It is used to illuminate fundamental aspects of oceanic shallow-cumulus boundary layer structure, including updraft buoyancy and vertical velocity scales, cumulus mass flux, temperature and humidity profiles, and trade-inversion height.The new model, like Albrecht et al.'s, includes a subcloud mixed layer and a cumulus layer with linear gradients of conserved thermodynamic variables, topped by a sharp capping inversion. Albrecht et al.'s model was not mathematically well posed, leading to an inconsistency between its heat and moisture balances at the inversion base. The new bulk model resolves this problem by diagnosing, rather than prognosing, the cumulus-layer gradients and introducing a penetrative entrainment closure to determine the growth of the cumulus layer into the overlying free troposphere. It uses more realistic assumptions about lateral cumulus entrainment and detrainment and a simplified sub-cloud-layer entrainment closure. When applied to a Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) trade-cumulus case, the steady state and the transient response of the bulk model to a sudden increase in sea surface temperature both compare favorably to a large-eddy simulation (LES).The new closure shows that penetrative entrainment constantly adjusts the cumulus-layer temperature and moisture profiles to keep the updraft buoyancy and vertical velocity small in inverse proportion to a penetrative entrainment efficiency A, estimated to be 5 from LES. Energy-balance arguments provide a skillful prediction of the steady-state bulk-model trade-inversion height. They also show that penetrative entrainment is driven by destabilization of the cumulus layer by radiative cooling and Lagrangian surface temperature increases.},

Model results are in good agreement with available in-situ observations, which provides confidence in the results of ATHAM.Sensitivity tests have been conducted to examine the response of the cloud fraction (CF), cloud liquid water path (LWP), and cloud optical depth ( COD) to changes in aerosols in the clean and polluted cases. It is shown for two cases that CF and LWP would decrease or remain nearly constant with an increase in aerosols, a result which shows that the second aerosol indirect effect is positive or negligibly small in these cases. Further investigation indicates that the background meteorological conditions play a critical role in the response of CF and LWP to aerosols. When large-scale subsidence is weak as in the clean case, the dry overlying air above the cloud is more efficiently entrained into the cloud, and in so doing, removes cloud water more efficiently, and results in lower CF and LWP when aerosol burden increases. However, when the large-scale subsidence is strong as in the polluted case, the growth of the cloud top is suppressed and the entrainment drying makes no significant difference when aerosol burden increases. Therefore, the CF and LWP remain nearly constant.In both the clean and polluted cases, the COD tends to increase with aerosols, and the total aerosol indirect effect (AIE) is negative even when the CF and LWP decrease with an increase in aerosols. Therefore, the first AIE dominates the response of the cloud to aerosols.},

	abstract = {The net shortwave radiative impact of aerosol on simulations of two shallow marine cloud cases is investigated using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer model. For a shallow cumulus case, increased aerosol concentrations are associated not only with smaller droplet sizes but also reduced cloud fractions and cloud dimensions, a result of evaporation-induced mixing and a lack of precipitation. Three-dimensional radiative transfer (3DRT) effects alter the fluxes by 10\% - 20\% from values calculated using the independent column approximation for these simulations. The first (Twomey) aerosol indirect effect is dominant but the decreased cloud fraction reduces the magnitude of the shortwave cloud forcing substantially. The 3DRT effects slightly decrease the sensitivity of the cloud albedo to changes in droplet size under an overhead sun for the two ranges of cloud liquid water paths examined, but not strongly so. A popular two-stream radiative transfer approximation to the cloud susceptibility overestimates the more directly calculated values for the low liquid-water-path clouds within pristine aerosol conditions by a factor of 2 despite performing well otherwise, suggesting caution in its application to the cloud albedos within broken cloud fields. An evaluation of the influence of cloud susceptibility and cloud fraction changes to a "domain" area-weighted cloud susceptibility found that the domain cloud albedo is more likely to increase under aerosol loading at intermediate aerosol concentrations than under the most pristine conditions, contrary to traditional expectations. The second simulation ( cumulus penetrating into stratus) is characterized by higher cloud fractions and more precipitation. This case has two regimes: a clean, precipitating regime where cloud fraction increases with increasing aerosol, and a more polluted regime where cloud fraction decreases with increasing aerosol. For this case the domain-mean cloud albedo increases steadily with aerosol loading under clean conditions, but increases only slightly after the cloud coverage decreases. Three-dimensional radiative transfer effects are mostly negligible for this case. Both sets of simulations suggest that aerosol-induced cloud fraction changes must be considered in tandem with the Twomey effect for clouds of small dimensions when assessing the net radiative impact, because both effects are drop size dependent and radiatively significant.},

	abstract = {An analysis of boundary layer cumulus clouds and their impact on land surface-atmosphere exchange is presented. Seasonal trends indicate that in response to increasing insolation and sensible heat flux. both the mixed-layer height (z(i)) and the lifting condensation level (LCL) peak (similar to 1250 and 1700 m) just before the growing season commences. With the commencement of transpiration. the Bowen ratio falls abruptly in response to the infusion of additional moisture into the boundary layer, and z(i) and LCL decrease. By late spring, boundary layer cumulus cloud frequency increases sharply, as the mixed layer approaches a new equilibrium, with z(i) and LCL remaining relatively constant (similar to 1100 and 1500 m) through the summer. Boundary layer cloud rime fraction peaks during the growing season. reaching values treater than 40\% over most of the eastern United States by June. At an Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) station in central Massachusetts, a growing season peak is apparent Juring 1995-98 but reveals large variations in monthly frequency due to periods of drought or excessive wetness. Light-cloud cover regression relationships developed from ASOS ceilometer reports for Orange. Massachusetts. and Harvard Forest insolation data show a good linear fit (r(2) = 0.83) for overall cloud cover versus insolation. and a reasonable quadratic fit (r(2) = 0.48) for cloud cover versus the standard deviation of insolation. which is an indicator of sky type. Diffuse fraction (the ratio of diffuse to global insolation) shows a very good correlation (r(2) = 0.79) with cloud cover. The sky type-insolation relationships are then used to analyze the impact that boundary layer clouds have on the forest ecosystem, specifically net carbon uptake (F-CO2), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE). During 1995, afternoon F-CO2 was 52\% greater on days with boundary layer cumulus clouds than on clear days, although ET was the same, indicating greater light use efficiency and WUE on partly cloudy days. For 1996-98, afternoon F-CO2 was also enhanced. especially during dry periods. Further analysis indicates that the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was significantly greater ({\textgreater}8 hPa) during 1995 and parts of 1996-98 on clear days as compared with partly cloudy days. A long-term drought combined with abnormally warm weather likely contributed to the high VPDs, reduced F-CO2. ET, and the dearth of clouds observed during 1995. In general, the presence of boundary layer cumulus clouds enhances net carbon uptake, as compared with clear days.},

	abstract = {The atmospheric effects of soot aerosols include interference with radiative transfer, visibility impairment, and alteration of cloud formation and are highly sensitive to the manner by which soot is internally mixed with other aerosol constituents. We present experimental studies to show that soot particles acquire a large mass fraction of sulfuric acid during atmospheric aging, considerably altering their properties. Soot particles exposed to subsaturated sulfuric acid vapor exhibit a marked change in morphology, characterized by a decreased mobility-based diameter but an increased fractal dimension and effective density. These particles experience large hygroscopic size and mass growth at subsaturated conditions ({\textless} 90\% relative humidity) and act efficiently as cloud-condensation nuclei. Coating with sulfuric acid and subsequent hygroscopic growth enhance the optical properties of soot aerosols, increasing scattering by approximate to 10-fold and absorption by nearly 2-fold at 80\% relative humidity relative to fresh particles. In addition, condensation of sulfuric acid is shown to occur at a similar rate on ambient aerosols of various types of a given mobility size, regardless of their chemical compositions and microphysical structures. Representing an important mechanism of atmospheric aging, internal mixing of soot with sulfuric acid has profound implications on visibility, human health, and direct and indirect climate forcing.},

	abstract = {An automated method aimed at producing a significant European mesoscale convective system (MCS) climatology is presented. It uses Meteosat infrared window channel images and is composed of two main tools: an automated cloud-shield tracking method and a robust method of discriminating between convective and non-convective cloud shields.The automated cloud-tracking method defines cloud systems as connected sets of pixels, named 'cells', after temperature and area thresholding and it is based on the overlapping between cells in successive images. It handles splits and merges of cells and takes cell movement into account. It has three parameters: the temperature and area thresholds and a minimum overlapping threshold. It is concluded that it performs a correct tracking at any temperature threshold between -30degreesC and -55degreesC and for an area threshold greater than 1000 km(2), so that it allows the tracking of MCSs during most of their life cycle.The automated discrimination between convective and non-convective cloud shields uses a discrimination parameter based on brightness-temperature gradients on the edges of cells, because strong values of this gradient are observed tit the beginning of the life cycle of MCSs when cold anvils develop. A seasonal study, and the sensitivity of the method to the temperature threshold, are presented. The method shows significant quality during the entire warm season (from April to September): it correctly discriminates 80\% of MCSs and more than 90\% of the most electrically active ones, while showing a low false-alarm rate around 8\%; therefore the method seems to be useful for climatological purposes.},

Thus, indirect aerosol effects are responsible for 72\% (- 8.8 W m(-2)) of the - 12.2 W m(-2) decrease in the shortwave radiation at the top-of-the atmosphere (TOA). Global climate model simulations with and without indirect aerosol effects confirm a decrease in TOA shortwave cloud forcing of - 9 W m(-2) over the Atlantic from the cleanest to the highest AOT due to indirect aerosol effects. While MODIS shows an increase in cloud fraction due to aerosols, in the model aerosols cause primarily an increase in cloud water. Thus, unlike the analysis from MODIS, the increase in cloud fraction with increasing AOT is dominated by changes in dynamical regimes, not by aerosol indirect effects.},

	abstract = {Modeled differences in predicted effects are increasingly used to help quantify the uncertainty of these effects. Here, we examine modeled differences in the aerosol indirect effect in a series of experiments that help to quantify how and why model-predicted aerosol indirect forcing varies between models. The experiments start with an experiment in which aerosol concentrations, the parameterization of droplet concentrations and the autoconversion scheme are all specified and end with an experiment that examines the predicted aerosol indirect forcing when only aerosol sources are specified. Although there are large differences in the predicted liquid water path among the models, the predicted aerosol first indirect effect for the first experiment is rather similar, about - 0.6 Wm(-2) to - 0.7 W m(-2). Changes to the autoconversion scheme can lead to large changes in the liquid water path of the models and to the response of the liquid water path to changes in aerosols. Adding an autoconversion scheme that depends on the droplet concentration caused a larger ( negative) change in net outgoing shortwave radiation compared to the 1st indirect effect, and the increase varied from only 22\% to more than a factor of three. The change in net shortwave forcing in the models due to varying the autoconversion scheme depends on the liquid water content of the clouds as well as their predicted droplet concentrations, and both increases and decreases in the net shortwave forcing can occur when autoconversion schemes are changed. The parameterization of cloud fraction within models is not sensitive to the aerosol concentration, and, therefore, the response of the modeled cloud fraction within the present models appears to be smaller than that which would be associated with model "noise". The prediction of aerosol concentrations, given a fixed set of sources, leads to some of the largest differences in the predicted aerosol indirect radiative forcing among the models, with values of cloud forcing ranging from - 0.3W m(-2) to - 1.4 W m(-2). Thus, this aspect of modeling requires significant improvement in order to improve the prediction of aerosol indirect effects.},

Results from ten CRMs are also used to diagnose problems in the SCMs.It is shown that most SCMs can generally capture well the convective events that were well-developed within the SCM domain, while most of them have difficulties in simulating the occurrence of those convective events that only occurred within a small part of the domain. All models significantly underestimate the surface stratiform precipitation. A third of them produce large errors in surface precipitation and thermodynamic structures. Deficiencies in convective triggering mechanisms are thought to be one of the major reasons. Using a triggering mechanism that is based on the vertical integral of parcel buoyant energy without additional appropriate constraints results in overactive convection, which in turn leads to large systematic warm/dry biases in the troposphere. It is also shown that a non-penetrative convection scheme can underestimate the depth of instability for midlatitude convection, which leads to large systematic cold/moist biases in the troposphere.SCMs agree well quantitatively with CRMs in the updraught mass fluxes, while most models significantly underestimate the downdraught mass fluxes. Neglect of mesoscale updraught and downdraught mass fluxes in the SCMs contributes considerably to the discrepancies between the SCMs and the CRMs. In addition, uncertainties in the diagnosed mass fluxes in the CRMs and deficiencies with cumulus parametrizations are not negligible.Similar results are obtained in the sensitivity tests when different forcing approaches are used. Finally. sensitivity tests from an SCM indicate that its simulations can be greatly improved when its triggering mechanism and closure assumption are improved.},

	abstract = {[1] An aerosol activation parameterization has been developed based on a generalized representation of aerosol size and composition within the framework of an ascending adiabatic parcel; this allows for parameterizing the activation of chemically complex aerosol with an arbitrary size distribution and mixing state. The new parameterization introduces the concept of "population splitting,” in which the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that form droplets are treated as two separate populations: those that have a size close to their critical diameter and those that do not. Explicit consideration of kinetic limitations on droplet growth is introduced. Our treatment of the activation process unravels much of its complexity. As a result of this, a substantial number of conditions of droplet formation can be treated completely free of empirical information or correlations; there are, however, some conditions of droplet activation for which an empirically derived correlation is utilized. Predictions of the parameterization are compared against extensive cloud parcel model simulations for a variety of aerosol activation conditions that cover a wide range of chemical variability and CCN concentrations. The parameterization tracks the parcel model simulations closely and robustly. The parameterization presented here is intended to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the aerosol indirect effect in general circulation models.},

	abstract = {A series of ozone transects measured each year from 1987 to 1990 over the western Pacific and eastern Indian oceans between mid-November and mid-December shows a prominent ozone maximum reaching 50-80 ppbv between 5 and 10 km in the 20 degrees S-40 degrees S latitude band. This maximum contrasts with ozone mixing ratios lower than 20 ppbv measured at the same altitudes in equatorial regions. Analyses with a global chemical transport model suggest that these elevated ozone values are part of a large-scale tropospheric ozone plume extending from Africa to the western Pacific across the Indian ocean. These plumes occur several months after the peak in biomass burning influence and during a period of high lightning activity in the Southern Hemisphere tropical belt. The composition and geographical extent of these plumes are similar to the ozone layers previously encountered during the biomass burning season in this region. Our model results suggest that production of nitrogen oxides from lightning strokes sustains the NOx (= NO + NO2) levels and the ozone photochemical production required in the upper troposphere to form these persistent elevated ozone layers emanating from biomass burning regions.},

	abstract = {Although emission of dust from the Patagonia desert is shown by global aerosol models, there is conflicting observational evidence of dust activity in the region. Because dust from Patagonia into the Southern Ocean ( SO) may play a role in regulating phytoplankton activity, it is necessary to confirm whether there is dust activity and if so, how far the dust travels into the SO. We used a combination of surface visibility, satellite measurements ( MODIS and OMI) and transport model (HYSPLIT) to track and report for the first time a dust event originating in Patagonia. We show that the dust reached the free troposphere in the Sub-Antarctic Atlantic Ocean. Although the dust emission was significant, cloudiness and dilution of the plume resulted in difficult conditions to track dust in the SW Atlantic. We show that the use of any single tool (i.e., MODIS or OMI) is not enough to track the dust and only an integrated approach of satellite and modeling tools can achieve a consistent description. As a result, current platforms used for dust detection are probably underestimating aerosol loading in the area.},

Isotopic tracers suggest that South America is the dominant source of the dust(10-12), but it is unclear what led to the variable deposition of dust at concentrations 20-50 times higher than present in glacial-aged ice(8,9). Here we characterize the age and composition of Patagonian glacial outwash sediments, to assess the relationship between the Antarctic dust record from Dome C (refs 9, 13) and Patagonian glacial fluctuations(14-16) for the past 80,000 years. We show that dust peaks in Antarctica coincide with periods in Patagonia when rivers of glacial meltwater deposited sediment directly onto easily mobilized outwash plains. No dust peaks were noted when the glaciers instead terminated directly into pro-glacial lakes. We thus propose that the variable sediment supply resulting from Patagonian glacial fluctuations may have acted as an on/off switch for Antarctic dust deposition. At the last glacial termination, Patagonian glaciers quickly retreated into lakes, which may help explain why the deglacial decline in Antarctic dust concentrations preceded the main phase of warming, sea-level rise and reduction in Southern Hemisphere sea-ice extent(13).},

The study represents an attempt to quantify the contribution of the major sources by tagging dust based on its origin. We evaluate the contribution of each source to the emission, distribution, mass burden and deposition of dust in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, and show that each source produces distinctive meridional transport, vertical distribution, and deposition patterns. The dust in SH originates primarily from Australia (120 Tg a(-1)), Patagonia (38 Tg a(-1)) and the inter-hemispheric transport from Northern Hemisphere (31 Tg a(-1)). A small fraction of it (7 Tg a(-1)) is transported and deposited in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, where dust from South America, Australia, and Northern Hemisphere are essentially located in the boundary layer, mid-troposphere, and upper-troposphere, respectively. These three sources contribute to nearly all the dust burden in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. South America and Australia are the main sources of the dust deposition, but they differ zonally, with each one dominating half of a hemisphere along 120 degrees E-60 degrees W: the half comprising the Atlantic and Indian oceans in the case of the South American dust and the Pacific half in the case of the Australian dust. Our study also indicates a potentially important role of Northern Hemisphere dust, as it appears to be a significant part of the dust burden but contributing little to the dust deposition in Antarctica.},

The cloud model represents turbulent cloud dynamics but parametrizes microphysical processes such as condensation, and the parcel model complements this approach by performing explicit microphysical calculations within the kinematic and thermodynamic constraints established by the cloud model. The parcel model is run along trajectories all ending at the same point in the cloud, and the individual droplet size distributions are averaged together at this point to represent the turbulent mixing together of the droplets produced by these different parcel trajectories.The results replicate some important features of observed cloud droplet size distributions, including large widths, the continued presence of small droplets high in the clouds, and the bimodal structure. The origin of these features in these calculations is the variability introduced by entrainment, which leads to possibilities for droplets to encounter varying supersaturation histories during their transit through the cloud to the point of observation. Droplet sizes larger than those calculated for adiabatic ascent are also produced, with possible implications for coalescence initiation.},

	abstract = {The leading empirical orthogonal function of the wintertime sea-level pressure field is more strongly coupled to surface air temperature fluctuations over the Eurasian continent than the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). It resembles the NAO in many respects; but its primary center of action covers more of the Arctic, giving it a more zonally symmetric appearance. Coupled to strong fluctuations at the 50-hPa level on the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this "Arctic Oscillation" (AO) can be interpreted as the surface signature of modulations in the strength of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends in winter and springtime surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past 30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by several K. These trends can be interpreted as the development of a systematic bias in one of the atmosphere's dominant, naturally occurring modes of variability.},

The combined effect of the two opposing variations may be a null effect on the cloud reflectivity. These results are consistent with the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) reflectivity measurements. The MCOT variation is further shown to be correlated with both the solar cycle and the ENSO cycle. Our present analysis cannot distinguish which of the above two provides better correlation, although independent data from the High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) from 1990 to 1996 favor the solar cycle. Future data are needed to identify the true cause of these changes.},

The PDF selected has the advantage of being bounded above and below, avoiding the complications of negative or infinite water mixing ratios, and can give both negatively and positively skewed functions as well as symmetric Gaussian-like bell-shaped curves, without discrete transitions, and is mathematically straightforward to implement.A development from previous statistical parameterizations is that the new scheme is prognostic, with processes such as deep convection, turbulence, and microphysics directly affecting the distribution of higher-order moments of variance and skewness. The scheme is able to represent the growth and decay of cirrus cloud decks and also the creation of cloud in clear sky or breakup of an overcast cloud deck by boundary layer turbulence. After introducing the mathematical framework, results using the parameterization in a climate model are shown to illustrate its behavior. The parameterization is shown to reduce cloud cover biases almost globally, with a marked improvement in the stratocumulus regions in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.},

	abstract = {A novel, flexible framework is proposed for parameterizing the heterogeneous nucleation of ice within clouds. It has empirically derived dependencies on the chemistry and surface area of multiple species of ice nucleus (IN) aerosols. Effects from variability in mean size, spectral width, and mass loading of aerosols are represented via their influences on surface area. The parameterization is intended for application in largescale atmospheric and cloud models that can predict 1) the supersaturation of water vapor, which requires a representation of vertical velocity on the cloud scale, and 2) concentrations of a variety of insoluble aerosol species.Observational data constraining the parameterization are principally from coincident field studies of IN activity and insoluble aerosol in the troposphere. The continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) was deployed. Aerosol species are grouped by the parameterization into three basic types: dust and metallic compounds, inorganic black carbon, and insoluble organic aerosols.Further field observations inform the partitioning of measured IN concentrations among these basic groups of aerosol. The scarcity of heterogeneous nucleation, observed at humidities well below water saturation for warm subzero temperatures, is represented. Conventional and inside- out contact nucleation by IN is treated with a constant shift of their freezing temperatures.The empirical parameterization is described and compared with available field and laboratory observations and other schemes. Alternative schemes differ by up to five orders of magnitude in their freezing fractions (-30 degrees C). New knowledge from future observational advances may be easily assimilated into the scheme's framework. The essence of this versatile framework is the use of data concerning atmospheric IN sampled directly from the troposphere.},

We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature).

	abstract = {Clouds exert a thermodynamic forcing on the ocean-atmosphere column through latent heating, owing to the production of rain, and through cloud radiative forcing, owing to the absorption of terrestrial infrared energy and the reflection of solar energy. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite provides, for the first time, simultaneous measurements of each of these processes on the spatial scales of individual clouds. Data from TRMM are used to examine the scale dependence of the cloud thermodynamic forcing and to understand the dominant spatial scales of forcing in monsoonal cloud systems. The tropical Indian Ocean is chosen, because the major monsoonal cloud systems are located over this region. Using threshold criteria, the satellite data are segmented into rain cells (consisting of only precipitating pixels) and clouds (consisting of precipitating as well as nonprecipitating pixels), ranging in scales from 10(3) km(2) to 10(6) km(2). For each rain cell and cloud, latent heating is estimated from the microwave imager and radiative forcing is estimated from the Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System radiation budget instrument.The sizes of clouds and rain cells over the tropical Indian Ocean are distributed lognormally. Thermodynamic forcing of clouds increases with rain cell and cloud area. For example, latent heating increases from about 100 W m(-2) for a rain cell of 10(3) km(2) to as high as 1500 W m(-2) for a rain cell of 10(6) km(2). Correspondingly, the liquid water path increases tenfold from 0.3 to nearly 3 kg m(-2), the longwave cloud forcing from 30 to 100 W m(-2), and the diurnal mean shortwave cloud forcing from -50 to -150 W m(-2). Previous studies have shown that in regions of deep convection, large clouds and rain cells express greater organization into structures composed of convective core regions attached to stratiform anvil cloud and precipitation. Entrainment of moist, cloudy air from the stratiform anvil into the convective core helps to sustain convection against the entrainment of unsaturated air. Thus large clouds produce more rain, trap more terrestrial radiation, and reflect more solar energy than do smaller clouds. The combined effect of increased forcing and increased spatial coverage means that larger clouds contribute most of the total forcing. Rain cells larger than 10(5) km(2) make up less than 2\% of the rain cell population, yet contribute greater than 70\% of the latent heating. Similarly, the clouds larger than 10(5) km(2), in which the largest rain cells are embedded, make up less than 3\% of clouds, yet are the source of greater than 90\% of the total thermodynamic forcing. Significant differences are apparent between the scales of latent heating and radiative forcing, as only about 25\% of cloud area is observed to precipitate. The fraction of clouds that contain some rain increases dramatically from about 5\% for the smaller scale (10(3) km(2)) to as high as 90\% for the largest scale considered here (10(6) km(2)). The fractional area of the precipitating cloud ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 with a hybrid-scale dependence. Greater than one-half of radiative forcing is provided by nonprecipitating anvil portions of deep convective cloud systems. The results presented here have significant implications for the parameterization of clouds and rain in GCMs and washout of solute trace gases and aerosols in chemistry and transport models.},

This period also witnessed strong negative trends of surface solar radiation, surface evaporation, and summer monsoon rainfall. These changes over India were accompanied by an increase in atmospheric stability and a decrease in sea surface temperature gradients in the Northern Indian Ocean. We conducted an ensemble of coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations from 1930 to 2000 to understand the role of atmospheric brown clouds in the observed trends. The simulations adopt the aerosol radiative forcing from the Indian Ocean experiment observations and also account for global increases in greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. The simulated decreases in surface solar radiation, changes in surface and atmospheric temperatures over land and sea, and decreases in monsoon rainfall are similar to the observed trends. We also show that greenhouse gases and sulfates, by themselves, do not account for the magnitude or even the sign in many instances, of the observed trends. Thus, our simulations suggest that absorbing aerosols in atmospheric brown clouds may have played a major role in the observed regional climate and hydrological cycle changes and have masked as much as 50\% of the surface warming due to the global increase in greenhouse gases. The simulations also raise the possibility that, if current trends in emissions continue, the subcontinent may experience a doubling of the drought frequency in the coming decades.},

	abstract = {This review is an overview of progress in understanding the theory and observation of the global atmospheric electric circuit, with the focus on its dc aspects, and its short and long term variability. The effects of the downward ionosphere-earth current density, J(z), on cloud microphysics, with its variability as an explanation for small observed changes in weather and climate, will also be reviewed. The global circuit shows responses to external as well as internal forcing. External forcing arises from changes in the distribution of conductivity due to changes in the cosmic ray flux and other energetic space particle fluxes, and at high magnetic latitudes from solar wind electric fields. Internal forcing arises from changes in the generators and changes in volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols in the troposphere and stratosphere. All these result in spatial and temporal variation in J(z).Variations in J(z) affect the production of space charge in layer clouds, with the charges being transferred to droplets and aerosol particles. New observations and new analyses are consistent with non-negligible effects of the charges on the microphysics of such clouds. Observed effects are small, but of high statistical significance for cloud cover and precipitation changes, with resulting atmospheric temperature, pressure and dynamics changes. These effects are detectable on the day-to-day timescale for repeated J(z) changes of order 10\%, and are thus second order electrical effects. The implicit first order effects have not, as yet, been incorporated into basic cloud and aerosol physics. Long term (multidecadal through millennial) global circuit changes, due to solar activity modulating the galactic cosmic ray flux, are an order of magnitude greater at high latitudes and in the stratosphere, as can be inferred from geological cosmogenic isotope records. Proxies for climate change in the same stratified depositories show strong correlations of climate with the inferred global circuit variations.The theory for electrical effects on scavenging of aerosols in clouds is reviewed, with several microphysical processes having consequences for contact ice nucleation; effects on droplet size distributions; precipitation and cloud lifetimes. There are several pathways for resulting macroscopic cloud changes that affect atmospheric circulation; including enhanced ice production and precipitation from clouds in cyclonic storms, with latent heat release affecting cyclone vorticity; and cloud cover changes in layer clouds that affect the atmospheric radiation balance. These macroscopic consequences of global circuit variability affecting aerosols-cloud interactions provide explanations for the many observations of short term and long term changes in clouds and climate that correlate with measured or inferred J(z) and cosmic ray flux changes due to external or internal forcing, and lead to predictions of additional effects.},

Although there may be calibration problems with the observations, uncertainties in model estimates of preindustrial natural emissions must also be considered. We show that a global three-dimensional model of tropospheric chemistry with reduced NOx emissions from lightning (1-2 Tg N yr(-1)) and soils (2 Tg N yr(-1)) and increased emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons can better reproduce the nineteenth century observations. The resulting global mean radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone since preindustrial times is 0.72-0.80 W m(-2), amounting to about half of the estimated CO2 forcing. Reduction in the preindustrial lightning source accounts for two thirds of the increase in the ozone forcing. Because there is near-total titration of OH by isoprene in the continental boundary layer of the preindustrial atmosphere, isoprene and other biogenic hydrocarbons represent significant ozone sinks. The weak dr absent spring maximum in the nineteenth century observations of ozone is difficult to explain within our understanding of the natural ozone budget. Our results indicate that the uncertainty in computing radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone since preindustrial times is larger than is usually acknowledged.},

New results based on an analysis of 33 years of northern hemisphere meteorological data show clear correlations of winter cyclone intensity (measured as the changes in the area in which vorticity is above a certain threshold) with day-to-day changes in the cosmic ray flux. Similar correlations are also present between winter cyclone intensity, the related storm track latitude shifts, and cosmic ray flux changes on the decadal time scale. These point to a mechanism in which atmospheric electrical processes affect tropospheric thermodynamics, with a requirement for energy amplification by a factor of about 107 and a time scale of hours. A process is hypothesized in which ionization affects the nucleation and/or growth rate of ice crystals in high-level clouds by enhancing the rate of freezing of thermodynamically unstable supercooled water droplets which are known to be present at the tops of high clouds. The electrofreezing increases the flux of ice crystals that can glaciate midlevel clouds. In warm core winter cyclones the consequent release of latent heat intensifies convection and extracts energy from the baroclinic instability to further intensify the cyclone. As a result, the general circulation in winter is affected in a way consistent with observed variations on the interannual/decadal time scale. The effects on particle concentration and size distributions in high-level clouds may also influence circulation via radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Two full months ( July 2003 and January 2004) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) Atmosphere Level-3 data from the Terra and Aqua satellites are analyzed in order to characterize the horizontal variability of vertically integrated cloud optical thickness ("cloud inhomogeneity") at global scales. The monthly climatology of cloud inhomogeneity is expressed in terms of standard parameters, initially calculated for each day of the month at spatial scales of 1 degrees X 1 degrees and subsequently averaged at monthly, zonal, and global scales. Geographical, diurnal, and seasonal changes of inhomogeneity parameters are examined separately for liquid and ice phases and separately over land and ocean. It is found that cloud inhomogeneity is overall weaker in summer than in winter. For liquid clouds, it is also consistently weaker for local morning than local afternoon and over land than ocean. Cloud inhomogeneity is comparable for liquid and ice clouds on a global scale, but with stronger spatial and temporal variations for the ice phase, and exhibits an average tendency to be weaker for near- overcast or overcast grid points of both phases. Depending on cloud phase, hemisphere, surface type, season, and time of day, hemispheric means of the inhomogeneity parameter nu( roughly the square of the ratio of optical thickness mean to standard deviation) have a wide range of similar to 1.7 to 4, while for the inhomogeneity parameter chi( the ratio of the logarithmic to linear mean) the range is from similar to 0.65 to 0.8. The results demonstrate that the MODIS Level- 3 dataset is suitable for studying various aspects of cloud inhomogeneity and may prove invaluable for validating future cloud schemes in large- scale models capable of predicting subgrid variability.},

By reviewing recent observational, numerical, and theoretical studies, this paper shows that there has been progress since the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in (i) the understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in these feedbacks, (ii) the interpretation of intermodel differences in global estimates of these feedbacks, and (iii) the development of methodologies of evaluation of these feedbacks ( or of some components) using observations.

While there is a large increase in the greenhouse effect from increasing greenhouse gases and water vapor (as a feedback), this is offset to a large degree by a decreasing greenhouse effect from reducing cloud cover and increasing radiative emissions from higher temperatures. Instead the main warming from an energy budget standpoint comes from increases in absorbed solar radiation that stem directly from the decreasing cloud amounts.

In the first, aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions and dynamical feedbacks were investigated to study the formation and evolution of open and closed cellular structures separately. In this paper, coexisting open and closed cells and how they influence one another are examined in a model domain of 180 x 60 x 1.5 km(3). Simulations show that gradients in aerosol at the open-closed-cell boundary cause gradients in precipitation that generate a mesoscale circulation. The circulation promotes precipitation in the polluted closed cells but suppresses it in open cells by transporting water vapor to the closed-cell regime and carrying drier air and aerosol back to the open cells. The strength of this circulation depends on the contrast in precipitation under clean and polluted conditions at the boundary. Ship plumes emitted into clean, precipitating regions, simulated as a special case of a clean-polluted boundary, develop a similar circulation. Drizzle in the ship track is first suppressed by the increase in aerosol particles but later recovers and becomes even stronger because the local circulation enhances liquid water path owing to the convergence of water vapor from the region adjacent to the track. This circulation modifies the transport and mixing of ship plumes and enhances their dispersal. Finally, results show that whereas ship emissions do increase cloud albedo in regions of open cells, even the addition of very large aerosol concentrations cannot transform an open cellular structure to a closed one, for the case considered.},

	abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interaction is recognized as one of the key factors influencing cloud properties and precipitation regimes across local, regional, and global scales and remains one of the largest uncertainties in understanding and projecting future climate changes. Deep convective clouds (DCCs) play a crucial role in the general circulation, energy balance, and hydrological cycle of our climate system. The complex aerosol-DCC interactions continue to be puzzling as more "aerosol effects” unfold, and systematic assessment of such effects is lacking. Here we systematically assess the aerosol effects on isolated DCCs based on cloud-resolving model simulations with spectral bin cloud microphysics. We find a dominant role of vertical wind shear in regulating aerosol effects on isolated DCCs, i.e., vertical wind shear qualitatively determines whether aerosols suppress or enhance convective strength. Increasing aerosols always suppresses convection under strong wind shear and invigorates convection under weak wind shear until this effect saturates at an optimal aerosol loading. We also found that the decreasing rate of convective strength is greater in the humid air than that in the dry air when wind shear is strong. Our findings may resolve some of the seemingly contradictory results among past studies by considering the dominant effect of wind shear. Our results can provide the insights to better parameterize aerosol effects on convection by adding the factor of wind shear to the entrainment term, which could reduce uncertainties associated with aerosol effects on climate forcing.},

While some observational and numerical studies report a decrease in precipitation in polluted areas, in some other observations and numerical studies aerosol-induced precipitation enhancement was reported.This study analyses possible reasons for the discrepancy between the results. The analysis of aerosol effects on precipitation is performed using the mass and heat budgets. The analysis is concentrated on clouds and cloud systems arising in the environment with relatively high freezing level. It is shown that for such clouds aerosols increase both the generation and the loss of the condensate mass. The net effect of aerosols on the precipitation depends on the environment conditions (air humidity, buoyancy, and wind shear) as well as on the cloud type determining whether the increase in the condensate generation or in the condensate loss will dominate with increase in the aerosol concentration. In the case when the loss increases more than the generation, a decrease in precipitation will take place. If the increase in the condensate generation dominates, an increase in precipitation will take place. A classification scheme of aerosol effects on precipitation is proposed and its relation to the observational and numerical results available is analysed. Possible reasons for the uncertainties and discrepancies of the numerical results, as well as between measurements, are analysed. A discussion of unsolved problems is presented in the conclusion.},

Of the three major causes for a stratospheric aerosol increase: volcanic emissions to the stratosphere, increased tropical upwelling, and an increase in anthropogenic sulfur gas emissions in the troposphere, it appears that a large increase in coal burning since 2002, mainly in China, is the likely source of sulfur dioxide that ultimately ends up as the sulfate aerosol responsible for the increased backscatter from the stratospheric aerosol layer. The results are consistent with 0.6-0.8\% of tropospheric sulfur entering the stratosphere. Citation: Hofmann, D., J. Barnes, M. O'Neill, M. Trudeau, and R.

In particular, methane emissions have a larger impact than that used in current carbon-trading schemes or in the Kyoto Protocol.

Models of varying complexity and satellite observations from NASA's A-Train constellation of satellites are used to determine what controls the precipitation susceptibility of warm clouds to aerosol perturbations. Three susceptibility regimes are identified: (i) clouds with low liquid water path (LWP) generate very little rain and are least susceptible to aerosol; (ii) clouds with intermediate LWP where aerosol most effectively suppress precipitation; and (iii) clouds with high LWP, where the susceptibility begins to decrease because the precipitation process is efficient owing to abundant liquid water. Remarkable qualitative agreement between remote sensing observations and model predictions provides the first suggestions that certain regions of the Earth might be more vulnerable to pollution aerosol. Targeted pollution control strategies in such regions would most benefit water availability via precipitation. Citation: Sorooshian, A., G. Feingold, M. D. Lebsock, H. Jiang, and G. L.

	abstract = {The equilibrium temperature and hydrological responses to the total aerosol effects (i.e., direct, semidirect, and indirect effects) are studied using a modified version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory atmosphere general circulation model (AM2.1) coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. The treatment of aerosol-liquid cloud interactions and associated indirect effects is based upon a prognostic scheme of cloud droplet number concentration, with an explicit representation of cloud condensation nuclei activation involving sulfate, organic carbon, and sea salt aerosols. Increasing aerosols from preindustrial (1860) to present-day (1990) levels leads to a decrease of 1.9 K in the global annual mean surface temperature. The cooling is relatively strong over the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude land owing to the high aerosol burden there, while being amplified at high latitudes. When being subject to aerosols and radiatively active gases (i.e., well-mixed greenhouse gases and ozone) simultaneously, the model climate behaves nonlinearly; the simulated increase in surface temperature (0.55 K) is considerably less than the arithmetic sum of separate aerosol and gas effects (0.86 K). The thermal responses are accompanied by the nonlinear changes in cloud fields, which are amplified owing to the surface albedo feedback at high latitudes. The two effects completely offset each other in the Northern Hemisphere, while gas effect is dominant in the Southern Hemisphere. Both factors are crucial in shaping the regional responses. Interhemispheric asymmetry in aerosol-induced cooling yields a southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone, thus giving rise to a significant reduction in precipitation north of the equator, and an increase to the south. The simulations show that the change of precipitation in response to the simultaneous increases in aerosols and gases not only largely follows the same pattern as that for aerosols alone, but that it is also substantially strengthened in terms of magnitude south of 10 degrees N. This is quite different from the damping expected from adding up individual responses, and further indicates the nonlinearity in the model's hydrological response.},

	abstract = {We examine the Earth's energy balance since 1950, identifying results that can be obtained without using global climate models. Important terms that can be constrained using only measurements and radiative transfer models are ocean heat content, radiative forcing by long-lived trace gases, and radiative forcing from volcanic eruptions. We explicitly consider the emission of energy by a warming Earth by using correlations between surface temperature and satellite radiant flux data and show that this term is already quite significant. About 20\% of the integrated positive forcing by greenhouse gases and solar radiation since 1950 has been radiated to space. Only about 10\% of the positive forcing (about 1/3 of the net forcing) has gone into heating the Earth, almost all into the oceans. About 20\% of the positive forcing has been balanced by volcanic aerosols, and the remaining 50\% is mainly attributable to tropospheric aerosols. After accounting for the measured terms, the residual forcing between 1970 and 2000 due to direct and indirect forcing by aerosols as well as semidirect forcing from greenhouse gases and any unknown mechanism can be estimated as -1.1 +/- 0.4 W m(-2) (1 sigma). This is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's best estimates but rules out very large negative forcings from aerosol indirect effects. Further, the data imply an increase from the 1950s to the 1980s followed by constant or slightly declining aerosol forcing into the 1990s, consistent with estimates of trends in global sulfate emissions. An apparent increase in residual forcing in the late 1990s is discussed.},

With the exception of the Chinese region, all the regions with high amounts of stratus clouds are over the oceans.In all regions except the Arctic, the season of maximum stratus corresponds to the season of greatest lower-troposphere static stability. Interannual variations in stratus cloud amount also are related to changes in static stability. A linear analysis indicates that a 6\% increase in stratus fractional area coverage is associated with each 1-degrees-C increase in static stability. Over midlatitude oceans, sky-obscuring fog is a large component of the summertime stratus amount. The amount of fog appears to be related to warm advection across sharp gradients of SST.},

We describe the aerosol properties of the tropical atmosphere and use composition tracers to examine particle sources, the role of recent convection, and cirrus-forming potential in the TTL. Tropical dynamics and regional air sources played principal roles in dictating tropospheric aerosol properties. There was a sharp change in aerosol chemical composition at about 12 km altitude coincident with a change in convective influence. Below this level, maritime convection lofted condensable material that generated acidic, sulfate-rich aerosol. These particles contained significant amounts of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and showed evidence of cloud processes. In contrast, continental convection injected particles and precursors directly into the TTL, yielding a population of neutralized, organic-rich aerosol. The organics were often highly oxidized and particles with oxidized organics also contained nitrate. Above the tropopause, chemical composition gradually changed toward sulfuric acid particles but neutralized particles were still abundant 2 km above the tropopause. Deep continental convection, though sporadic and geographically localized, may strongly influence TTL aerosol properties on a global scale. The abundance of organic-rich aerosol may inhibit ice nucleation and formation of tropopause level cirrus.},

Temperature observations show that the tropical tropopause has been anomalously cold during this period, and the observed water vapor changes ( approximately - 0.4 ppmv) are consistent with the temperature decreases ( approximately - 1 K). The cold anomalies occur in the tropics over a narrow vertical layer near 15 - 20 km. There have been corresponding changes in the tropical ozone profile over the same period, with similar to 10\% reductions over a similar narrow layer near the tropopause. The variations in temperature and ozone appear coupled, and the spatial patterns of the changes since 2001 are consistent with an increase in the mean tropical upwelling (Brewer-Dobson) circulation. Estimates of tropical upwelling derived from eddy statistics ("downward control”) show coherence with interannual temperature changes, including a consistent increase after 2001. Part of the temperature changes may also be explained as a radiative response to the observed ozone decreases. The results paint a consistent picture of enhanced tropical upwelling after 2001, resulting in colder temperatures, lower water vapor and lower ozone near the tropical tropopause. The recent low values significantly influence estimates of decadal-scale trends in temperature and ozone near the tropical tropopause.},

The main features of this system are the following: 1) a cloud cluster detection method based on a threshold temperature (235 K), 2) a tracking technique based on MCS overlapping areas in successive images, and 3) a forecast module based on the evolution of each particular MCS in previous steps. This feature is based on the MCS's possible displacement (considering the center of the mass position of the cloud cluster in previous time steps) and its size evolution. Statistical information about MCS evolution during the Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) was used to obtain area expansion mean rates for different MCSs according to their lifetime durations. This nowcasting tool was applied to evaluate the MCS displacement and size evolution over the Del Plata basin in South America up to 120 min with 30-min intervals. The Forecast and Tracking the Evolution of Cloud Clusters (ForTraCC) technique's performance was evaluated based on the difference between the forecasted and observed images. This evaluation shows good agreement between the observed and forecast size and minimum temperature for shorter forecast lead times, but tends to underestimate MCS size (and overestimate the minimum temperature) for larger forecast lead times.},

Here, we analyse spectrally resolved measurements of infrared radiance from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer(9) on board the NASA Aura satellite, as well as corresponding estimates of atmospheric ozone and water vapour, to obtain the reduction in clear-sky outgoing long-wave radiation due to ozone in the upper troposphere over the oceans.

	abstract = {This article addresses the need for new data on indirect effects of natural and anthropogenic aerosol particles on atmospheric ice clouds. Simultaneous measurements of the concentration and composition of tropospheric aerosol particles capable of initiating ice in cold (cirrus) clouds are reported. Measurements support that cirrus formation occurs both by heterogeneous nucleation by insoluble particles and homogeneous (spontaneous) freezing of particles containing solutions. Heterogeneous ice nuclei concentrations in the cirrus regime depend on temperature, relative humidity, and the concentrations and physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles. The cirrus-active concentrations of heterogeneous nuclei measured in November over the western U.S. were {\textless}0.03 cm(-3). Considering previous modeling studies, this result suggests a predominant potential impact of these nuclei on cirrus formed by slow, large-scale lifting or small cooling rates, including subvisual cirrus. The most common heterogeneous ice nuclei were identified as relatively pure mineral dusts and metallic particles, some of which may have origin through anthropogenic processes. Homogeneous freezing of large numbers of particles was detected above a critical relative humidity along with a simultaneous transition in nuclei composition toward that of the sulfate-dominated total aerosol population. The temperature and humidity conditions of the homogeneous nucleation transition were reasonably consistent with expectations based on previous theoretical and laboratory studies but were highly variable. The strong presence of certain organic pollutants was particularly noted to be associated with impedance of homogeneous freezing.},

The follow-on SCM-sensitivity simulations showed that accretion of cloud water is sensitive to i) the terminal velocity of hydrometeors produced by autoconversion and ii) cloud height increases due to in-cloud condensation heating. The impact of aerosol mass concentration on the resultant column cloud water, and bulk optical properties of clouds were assessed by using 1/8 to 8 times the average monthly aerosol mass concentration estimates of GOCART aerosol climatology.

	abstract = {Latent heating profiles associated with three TOGA COARE active convective episodes (December 10-17 1992; December 19-27 1992; and February 9-13 1993) are examined using the two-dimensional version of the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) Model, and retrieved by using the Goddard Convective and Stratiform Heating (CSH) algorithm. The following sources of rainfall information are input into the CSH algorithm: Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), shipborne radars and the GCE model. Diagnostically determined latent heating profiles are calculated using 6 hourly soundings used for validation.The GCE model simulated rainfall and latent heating profiles are in excellent agreement with those estimated by soundings. In addition, the typical convective and stratiform heating structures (or shapes) are well captured by the GCE model. Radar measured rainfall is smaller than that estimated by the GCE model and SSM/I in both December convective episodes. SSM/I derived rainfall is more than the GCE model simulated for the December 19-27 and February 9-13 periods, but it is in excellent agreement with the GCE model for the December 10-17 period. The GCE model estimated stratiform amount is about 50 \% for December 19-27, 42 \% for December 11-17 and 56 \% for the February 9-13 case. These results are consistent with large-scale analyses. Accurate estimates of stratiform amount are needed for good latent heating retrieval. A higher (lower) percentage of stratiform rain can imply a maximum heating rate at a higher (lower) altitude. The GCE model always simulates more stratiform rain (10 to 20 \%) than the radar for all three convective episodes. The SSM/I derived stratiform amount is about 37 \% for December 19-27, 48 \% for December 11-17 and 41 \% for the February 9-13 case.Temporal variability of CSH algorithm retrieved latent heating profiles using either the GCE model simulated or radar estimated rainfall and stratiform amount is in good agreement with that diagnostically determined for all three periods. However, less rainfall and a smaller stratiform percentage estimated by radar resulted in a weaker (underestimated) latent heating profile, and a lower maximum latent heating level compared to those determined diagnostically. Rainfall information from SSM/I can not retrieve individual convective events due to poor temporal sampling. Nevertheless, this study suggests that a good rainfall retrieval from SSM/I for a convective event can lead to a good latent heating retrieval.Sensitivity testing has been performed and the results indicate that the SSM/I derived time averaged stratiform amount may be underestimated for December 19-27. Time averaged heating profiles derived from SSM/I, however, agree well with those derived by soundings for the December 10-17 convective period. The heating retrievals may be more accurate for longer time scales, provided there is no bias in the sampling.An appropriate selection of latent heating profiles from the CSH look-up table is important. Sensitivity tests addressing this issue have been performed.},

These algorithms are briefly described, followed by a discussion of the latent heating products that they generate.

	abstract = {Anvils produced by vigorous tropical convection contribute significantly to the earth's radiation balance, and their radiative properties depend largely on the concentrations and sizes of the ice particles that form them. These microphysical properties are determined to an important extent by the fate of supercooled droplets, with diameters from 3 to about 20 microns, lofted in the updrafts. The present study addresses the question of whether most or all of these droplets are captured by ice particles or if they remain uncollected until arriving at the -38 degrees C level where they freeze by homogeneous nucleation, producing high concentrations of very small ice particles that can persist and dominate the albedo.Aircraft data of ice particle and water droplet size distributions from seven field campaigns at latitudes from 25 degrees N to 11 degrees S are combined with a numerical model in order to examine the conditions under which significant numbers of supercooled water droplets can be lofted to the homogeneous nucleation level. Microphysical data were collected in pristine to heavily dust-laden maritime environments, isolated convective updrafts, and tropical cyclone updrafts with peak velocities reaching 25 m s(-1). The cumulative horizontal distance of in-cloud sampling at temperatures of -20 degrees C and below exceeds 50 000 km. Analysis reveals that most of the condensate in these convective updrafts is removed before reaching the -20 degrees C level, and the total condensate continues to diminish linearly upward. The amount of condensate in small ({\textless}50 mu m in diameter) droplets and ice particles, however, increases upward, suggesting new droplet activation with an appreciable radiative impact. Conditions promoting the generation of large numbers of small ice particles through homogeneous ice nucleation include high concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (sometimes from dust), removal of most of the water substance between cloud base and the -38 degrees C levels, and acceleration of the updrafts at mid-and upper levels such that velocities exceed 5-7 m s(-1).},

	abstract = {The effects of cloud structures on microwave radiances at frequencies from 89-190 GHz are investigated by simulations using the Goddard cumulus ensemble model data as input for a radiative transfer model. It was found that the brightness temperatures at these frequencies have different sensitivities to clouds with a tilted structure. The different sensitivities to altitude and amount of hydrometeors allow the estimation of the canting angle and tilt direction of tilted clouds using brightness temperatures at the water vapor channels at 183.3 I and 183.3 7 GHz. The estimated canting angle and tilt direction are in agreement with the model situation. This method provides a potential to estimate tilted convective structures from microwave radiometric observations at 183.3 +/- 1 and 183.3 +/- 7 GlIz. It is applied to a tilted storm observed from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ER-2 aircraft flying at about 20 km on August 26, 1998 during the third Convection and Moisture Experiment using the observed downlooking brightness temperatures at the water vapor channels of a Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer. The estimated results are in good agreement with the realistic storm situation obtained from the simultaneous observations of the ER-2 Doppler radar. This method also provides information about the vertical displacement of cloud structure and thereby to estimate the accurate location of surface rainfall. This is important when validating precipitation retrieval based on observations of the ice scattering above surface rainfall against surface rain observations using the microwave frequencies sensitive to high altitudes.},

The lack of distinction in the electrical parameters (peak flash rate, lightning yield per unit rainfall) between aerosol-rich October and aerosol-poor November in the premonsoon regime casts doubt on a primary role for the aerosol in enhancing cloud electrification. Evidence for a substantial role for the aerosol in suppressing warm rain coalescence is identified in the most highly polluted period in early October. The electrical activity in this stage is qualitatively peculiar. During the easterly and westerly wind regimes of the wet season, the lightning yield per unit of rainfall is positively correlated with the aerosol concentration, but the electrical parameters are also correlated with CAPE, with a similar degree of scatter. Here cause and effect are difficult to establish with available observations. This ambiguity extends to the "green ocean" westerly regime, a distinctly maritime regime over a major continent with minimum aerosol concentration, minimum CAPE, and little if any lightning.},

	abstract = {A 3-minute 3-km rapid scan of the METEOSAT Second Generation geostationary satellite over southern Africa was applied to tracking the evolution of cloud top temperature ( T) and particle effective radius (r(e)) of convective elements. The evolution of T - r(e) relations showed little dependence on time, leaving re to depend almost exclusively on T. Furthermore, cloud elements that fully grew to large cumulonimbus stature had the same T - r(e) relations as other clouds in the same area with limited development that decayed without ever becoming a cumulonimbus. Therefore, a snap shot of T - r(e) relations over a cloud field provides the same relations as composed from tracking the time evolution of T and re of individual clouds, and then compositing them. This is the essence of exchangeability of time and space scales, i.e., ergodicity, of the T - r(e) relations for convective clouds. This property has allowed inference of the microphysical evolution of convective clouds with a snap shot from a polar orbiter. The fundamental causes for the ergodicity are suggested to be the observed stability of re for a given height above cloud base in a convective cloud, and the constant renewal of growing cloud tops with cloud bubbles that replace the cloud tops with fresh cloud matter from below.},

Sharp transitions are observed across the Kuroshio Extension (KE) front in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and its clouds. The ocean's influence appears to extend beyond the MABL, with higher cloud tops in altitude along the KE front than the surroundings. In winter, intense turbulent heat release from the ocean takes place on the southern flank of the KE front, where the cloud top penetrates above the MABL and reaches the midtroposphere. In this band of high cloud tops, frequent lightning activity is observed. The results of this study suggest a sea level pressure mechanism for which the temperature gradient in the MABL induces strong surface wind convergence on the southern flank of the KE front, deepening the clouds there.

Nevertheless, many research methods are premised on a dichotomy of states-for example, those that use 'cloud cover' or 'cloud-clearing.' Here we consider the consequences of this practice for studies of aerosol-climate effects. Aerosols affect the Earth's energy budget primarily by affecting albedo; therefore, we explore the nature of albedo variability in the partly cloudy marine boundary layer on scales down to a few tens of metres. We employ two diagnostic tools: a cloud resolving model and an albedo proxy derived from high altitude lidars. We show that a continuum of albedo values results from indeterminate and variable combinations of hydrated aerosol and wispy (including subvisible) clouds. Two consequences arise. First, cloud-clearing schemes employed by different observational methods are mutually inconsistent and are sensitive to concentrations of unactivated aerosol particles. Second, aerosol radiative forcing (the sensitivity of overall albedo to changes in aerosol concentration) is inaccurately calculated as the average of clear and overcast conditions. Together, these results imply that dividing the aerosol forcing problem into 'direct' and 'indirect' components may lead to substantial errors.},

	abstract = {Testing general circulation model parameterizations against observations is traditionally done by comparing simulated and observed, time-averaged quantities, such as monthly mean cloud cover, evaluated on a stationary grid. This approach ignores the dynamical aspects of clouds, such as their life cycle characteristics, spatial coverage, temporal duration, and internal variability. In this study, a complementary Lagrangian approach to the validation of modeled tropical cloudiness is explored. An automated cloud detection and tracking algorithm is used to observe and track overcast decks of cloud in a consecutive set of hourly Meteosat-5 images and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model version 3 (NCAR CCM3). The algorithm is applied to the deep convective cloud systems of the tropical Indian Ocean region during a 49-day period of the 1999 winter monsoon season. Observations of precipitation are taken from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite in addition to a Meteosat-5 infrared rainfall technique that is calibrated using the TRMM data.Clouds, defined as overcast decks, are observed spanning spatial scales from 25 km(2) to greater than 10(7) km(2), as well as temporal scales from 1 h to greater than 100 h. Semipermanent decks of anvil and cirrus cloud, with numerous regions of deep convection embedded within, dominate total cloud cover. Bridging between convective centers within the deck by cirrus clouds, particularly during the suppressed portion of the diurnal cycle of convection, may help to maintain the integrity of semipermanent overcast decks over long timescales. At scales greater than 10(6) km(2) the size distribution of simulated clouds is biased such that the dominant scale of clouds is several million square kilometers larger than the dominant scale of observed clouds. Virtually all of the simulated precipitation occurs at rain rates lower than 2 mm h(-1), while as much as 25\% of observed precipitation occurs at rain rates higher than 2 mm h(-1). Precipitation associated with deep convection in observed semipermanent cloud systems is organized into more localized mesoscale structures of adjacent convective cells attached to stratiform precipitation regions. A separate analysis of TRMM data by Wilcox and Ramanathan determined that such structures can exceed the size of grid cells in coarse-grid global models and have area-averaged rain rates up to and exceeding 2 mm h(-1). These mesoscale convective systems are responsible for the extreme, episodic precipitation events that are not parameterized in the model. The simulated cloud systems gently precipitate throughout their duration and everywhere within their boundaries. The model lacks a process that acts to organize the convective cells within fewer grid cells, in addition to a representation of the observed stratiform precipitation structures. A modification to CCM3 is tested that is intended to account for the evaporation of upper-level precipitation in midlevel mesoscale downdrafts. The modification results in only a slight change in domain-averaged precipitation. However, it causes a significant shift in the distribution of precipitation toward higher rain rates that is more consistent with the distribution of TRMM observed rain rates. The modification demonstrates the sensitivity of the model to one important component of mesoscale organized convection.},

	abstract = {In past modeling studies, it has generally been assumed that the predominant mechanism for nucleation of ice in the uppermost troposphere is homogeneous freezing of aqueous aerosols. However, recent in situ and remote-sensing measurements of the properties of cirrus clouds at very low temperatures in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) are broadly inconsistent with theoretial predictions based on the homogeneous freezing assumption. The nearly ubiquitous occurence of gravity waves in the TTL makes the predictions from homogeneous nucleation theory particularly difficult to reconcile with measurements. These measured properties include ice number concentrations, which are much lower than theory predicts; ice crystal size distributions, which are much broader than theory predicts; and cloud extinctions, which are much lower than theory predicts. Although other explanations are possible, one way to limit ice concentrations is to have on the order of 50 L-1 effective ice nuclei (IN) that could nucleate ice at relatively low supersaturations. We suggest that ammonium sulfate particles, which would be dry much of the time in the cold TTL, are a potential IN candidate for TTL cirrus. However, this mechanism remains to be fully quantified for the size distribution of ammonium sulfate (possibly internally mixed with organics) actually present in the upper troposphere. Possible implications of the observed cloud microphysical properties for ice sedimentation, dehydration, and cloud persistence are also discussed.},

Where possible (40 degrees N40 degreesS), the Threshold-Matched Precipitation Index (TMPI) provides precipitation estimates in which the 3-hourly infrared brightness temperatures (IR T-b) are compared with a threshold and all "cold" pixels are given a single precipitation rate. This approach is an adaptation of the Geoatationary Operational Environmental Satellite Precipitation Index, but for the TMPI the IR T-b threshold and conditional min rate are set locally by month from Special Sensor Microwave Imager-based precipitation frequency and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) satellite-gauge (SG) combined monthly precipitation estimate, respectively. At higher latitudes the 1DD features a rescaled daily Television and Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) precipitation. The frequency of rain days in the TOVS is scaled down to match that in the TMPI at the data boundaries, and the resulting nonzero TOVS values are scaled locally to sum to the SC; (which is a globally complete monthly product).The GPCP has approved the IDD as an official product, and data have been produced for 1997 through 1999, with production continuing a few months behind real time (to allow access to monthly input data). The time series of the daily IDD global images shows good continuity in time and across the data boundaries. Various examples are shown to illustrate uses. Validation for individual gridbox values shows a very high mean absolute error, but it improves quickly when users perform time/space averaging according to their own requirements.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and satellite-based assessments of the sensitivity of broadband shortwave radiative fluxes in cloudy atmospheres to small perturbations in the cloud droplet number concentration (N) of liquid water clouds under constant water conditions are performed. Two approaches to study this sensitivity are adopted: absolute increases in N, for which the radiative response is referred to as "absolute cloud susceptibility,” and relative increases in N or "relative cloud susceptibility.” Estimating the former is more challenging as it requires an assumed value for either cloud liquid water content or geometrical thickness; both susceptibilities require an assumed relationship between the droplet volume and effective radius. Expanding upon previous susceptibility studies, present radiative calculations include the effect of Delta N perturbations on droplet asymmetry parameter and single-scattering albedo, in addition to extinction. Absolute cloud susceptibility has a strong nonlinear dependence on the droplet effective radius as expected, while relative cloud susceptibility is primarily dependent on optical thickness. Molecular absorption and reflecting surfaces both reduce the relative contribution of the cloud to the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) flux and therefore also reduce the TOA albedo susceptibility. Transmittance susceptibilities are negative with absolute values similar to albedo susceptibility, while atmospheric absorptance susceptibilities are about an order of magnitude smaller than albedo susceptibilities and can be either positive or negative. Observation-based susceptibility calculations are derived from MODIS pixel-level retrievals of liquid water cloud optical thickness, effective radius, and cloud top temperature; two data granule examples are shown. Susceptibility quantifies the aerosol indirect effect sensitivity in a way that can be easily computed from model fields. As such, susceptibilities derived from MODIS observations provide a higher-order test of model cloud properties used for indirect effect studies. MODIS-derived global distributions of cloud susceptibility and radiative forcing calculations are presented in a companion paper.},

We present evidence that recent trends in the SH tropospheric circulation can be interpreted as a bias toward the high-index polarity of this pattern, with stronger westerly flow encircling the polar cap. It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.},

Part 1 of this paper addresses the responses to aerosol perturbations in India and Africa. This paper presents the same for aerosol perturbations over the Americas. GEOS-4 is forced with prescribed aerosols based on climatological data, which interact with clouds using a prognostic scheme for cloud microphysics including aerosol nucleation of water and ice cloud hydrometeors. In clear-sky conditions the aerosols interact with radiation. Thus the model includes comprehensive physics describing the aerosol direct and indirect effects on climate (hereafter ADE and AIE respectively). Each simulation is started from analyzed initial conditions for 1 May and was integrated through June-July-August of each of the six years: 1982-1987 to provide a 6-ensemble set. Results are presented for the difference between simulations with double the climatological aerosol concentration and one-half the climatological aerosol concentration for three experiments: two where the ADE and AIE are applied separately and one in which both the ADE and AIE are applied. The ADE and AIE both yield reductions in net radiation at the top of the atmosphere and surface while the direct absorption of short-wave radiation contributes a net radiative heating in the atmosphere. A large net heating of the atmosphere is also apparent over the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean that is attributable to the large aerosol perturbation imposed over Africa. This atmospheric warming and the depression of the surface pressure over North America contribute to a northward shift of the inter-Tropical Convergence Zone over northern South America, an increase in precipitation over Central America and the Caribbean, and an enhancement of convergence in the North American monsoon region.},

This joint Japan-U.S. cooperative Earth Probe satellite will be launched from Japan in 1997 for a three-year mission. The scientific basis of the instrument and orbit selection is explained. The precipitation instrument complement comprises the first rain radar to be flown in space (PR), and a multi-channel passive microwave sensor (TMI) improved relative to the SSM/I-1 by an additional channel at 10 GHz. The third rain instrument is a live-channel VIS/IR (VIRS) sensor. Progress in construction of instruments, observatory, data system, and the ground validation program is summarized. A report is also given concerning development of the algorithms by which rainfall and its associated latent heat release will be calculated from the several instruments, separately and in combination, and how the scientists will interact with the data system to obtain the 32 rain data products necessary to fulfill the science requirements.},

	abstract = {The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite was launched on 27 November 1997, and data from all the instruments first became available approximately 30 days after the launch. Since then, much progress has been made in the calibration of the sensors, the improvement of the rainfall algorithms, and applications of these results to areas such as data assimilation and model initialization. The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) calibration has been corrected and verified to account for a small source of radiation leaking into the TMI receiver. The precipitation radar calibration has been adjusted upward slightly (by 0.6 dBZ) to match better the ground reference targets; the visible and infrared sensor calibration remains largely unchanged. Two versions of the TRMM rainfall algorithms are discussed. The at-launch (version 4) algorithms showed differences of 40\% when averaged over the global Tropics over 30-day periods. The improvements to the rainfall algorithms that were undertaken after launch are presented, and intercomparisons of these products (version 5) show agreement improving to 24\% for global tropical monthly averages. The ground-based radar rainfall product generation is discussed. Quality-control issues have delayed the routine production of these products until the summer of 2000, but comparisons of TRMM products with early versions of the ground validation products as well as with rain gauge network data suggest that uncertainties among the TRMM algorithms are of approximately the same magnitude as differences between TRMM products and ground-based rainfall estimates. The TRMM field experiment program is discussed to describe active areas of measurements and plans to use these data for further algorithm improvements. In addition to the many papers in this special issue, results coming from the analysis of TRMM products to study the diurnal cycle, the climatological description of the vertical profile of precipitation, storm types, and the distribution of shallow convection, as well as advances in data assimilation of moisture and model forecast improvements using TRMM data, are discussed in a companion TRMM special issue in the Journal of Climate (1 December 2000, Vol. 13, No. 23).},

	abstract = {The global response to tropical heating is studied by performing a time integration of a 15-level primitive equation model, starting with a basic flow maintained by a constant forcing. The direct, quasi-steady response to the tropical heating is seen during the first 20 days before baroclinic instability dominates. This technique enables the investigation of a variety of basic flows, from a resting state to a December-February 3D time-mean flow; of the timescales for establishing remote responses; and of nonlinear effects. It also allows the determination of timescales for the establishment of the response. The Gill-type response is seen in the lower troposphere in all cases. In the upper troposphere, depending on the basic conditions, the simple tropical quadrupole response of the Gill model shows considerable modification. The anticyclonic pair can be centered over the heating and can vary substantially in magnitude and vertical extent. The Rossby wave source and the upper-tropospheric divergence above the heating region is always found, but the existence and relative magnitudes of local Hadley and Walker cells as measured by upper-tropospheric convergence are strong functions of the flow. Both the Rossby wave source and the Rossby wave propagation are also strongly influenced by the ambient flow. Wave patterns extend to the equator in the regions in which the basic westerlies extend to the equator. Significant tropical zonal flow variations, which are also very dependent on the basic flow and the position of the heating, are also produced. The tropical and midlatitude response are generally established within a week. In an additional week the high-latitude pattern is determined and the subtropical wave pattern propagates back into the Tropics in the westerly wind regions. Nonlinear effects are found to be minor in all cases before the middle-latitude transients develop. On the two-week timescale of interest here, the sensitivity of steady-state models to the dissipations employed and to the existence of low-frequency modes is not found.},

	abstract = {Ozone is produced in the troposphere by gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons and CO catalyzed by hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx = OH + H + peroxy radicals) and nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx = NO + NO2). Heterogeneous chemistry involving reactions in aerosol particles and cloud droplets may affect O-3 concentrations in a number of ways including production and loss of HOx and NOx, direct loss of O-3 and production of halogen radicals. Current knowledge and hypotheses regarding these processes are reviewed. It is recommended that standard O-3 models include in their chemical mechanisms the following reaction probability parameterizations for reactive uptake of gases by aqueous aerosols and clouds: gamma(HO2) = 0.2 (range 0.1-1) for HO2 –{\textgreater} 0.5 H2O2, gamma(NO2) = 10(-4) (10(-6)-10(-3)) for NO2 –{\textgreater} 0.5 HONO + 0.5 HNO3, gamma(NO3) = 10(-3) (2 X 10(-4)-10(-2)) for NO3 –{\textgreater} HNO3, and gamma(N2O5) = 0.1 (0.01-1) for N2O5 –{\textgreater} 2 HNO3. Current knowledge does not appear to warrant a more detailed approach. Hypotheses regarding fast O-3 loss on soot or in clouds, fast reduction of HNO3 to NOx in aerosols, or heterogeneous loss of CH2O are not supported by evidence. Halogen radical chemistry could possibly be significant in the marine boundary layer but more evidence is needed. Recommendations for future research are presented. They include among others (1) improved characterization of the phase and composition of atmospheric aerosols, in particular the organic component; (2) aircraft and ship studies of marine boundary layer chemistry; (3) measurements of HONO vertical profiles in urban boundary layers, and of the resulting HOx source at sunrise; (4) laboratory studies of the mechanisms for reactions of peroxy radicals, NO2 and HNO3 on surfaces representative of atmospheric aerosol; and (4) laboratory studies of O-3 reactivity on organic aerosols and mineral dust.

	abstract = {A new two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme in a general circulation model is described. Prognostic variables include cloud droplet and cloud ice mass mixing ratios and number concentrations. The scheme treats several microphysical processes, including hydrometeor collection, condensation/ evaporation, freezing, melting, and sedimentation. The activation of droplets on aerosol is physically based and coupled to a subgrid vertical velocity. Unique aspects of the scheme, relative to existing two-moment schemes developed for general circulation models, are the diagnostic treatment of rain and snow number concentration and mixing ratio and the explicit treatment of subgrid cloud water variability for calculation of the microphysical process rates.Numerical aspects of the scheme are described in detail using idealized one-dimensional offline tests of the microphysics. Sensitivity of the scheme to time step, vertical resolution, and numerical method for diagnostic precipitation is investigated over a range of conditions. It is found that, in general, two substeps are required for numerical stability and reasonably small time truncation errors using a time step of 20 min; however, substepping is only required for the precipitation microphysical processes rather than the entire scheme. A new numerical approach for the diagnostic rain and snow produces reasonable results compared to a benchmark simulation, especially at low vertical resolution. Part II of this study details results of the scheme in single-column and global simulations, including comparison with observations.},

The simulations include the secondary-flow transition starting with the relatively small-scale boundary-layer rolls developing during the initial phase and ending with mesoscale cellular convection patterns. The application of a computational grid, whose horizontal mesh size enables the resolution of the small-scale initial patterns and whose domain size is large enough to capture mesoscale convection patterns, overcharges even state-of-the-art supercomputers. In order to bypass the computer storage problem, the horizontal size of the model domain and the horizontal resolution of the computational grid are adjusted to the scale of the dominant convective structures. This enables the simulation of convection cells whose horizontal scales increase up to values exceeding the size of the initial model domain. The model is applied to conditions of a cold-air outbreak observed during the ARKTIS 1991 experiment. The most important characteristics of the observed situation are revealed by the model. Sensitivity studies are performed in order to investigate the relation between cell broadening and various physical processes. The artificial cutoff of liquid-water formation prevents the enlargement of convective scales. Latent heating due to condensation and especially radiative cloud-top cooling are identified as processes leading to cell broadening. We propose a conceptual model that elucidates the mechanism by which cloud-top cooling may generate larger aspect ratios.},

	abstract = {A common deficiency of many cloud-physics parameterizations including the NASA's microphysics of clouds with aerosol-cloud interactions (hereafter called McRAS-AC) is that they simulate lesser (larger) than the observed ice cloud particle number (size). A single column model (SCM) of McRAS-AC physics of the GEOS4 Global Circulation Model (GCM) together with an adiabatic parcel model (APM) for ice-cloud nucleation (IN) of aerosols were used to systematically examine the influence of introducing ammonium sulfate (NH4)(2)SO4 aerosols in McRAS-AC and its influence on the optical properties of both liquid and ice clouds. First an (NH4)(2)SO4 parameterization was included in the APM to assess its effect on clouds vis-A -vis that of the other aerosols. Subsequently, several evaluation tests were conducted over the ARM Southern Great Plain (SGP) and thirteen other locations (sorted into pristine and polluted conditions) distributed over marine and continental sites with the SCM. The statistics of the simulated cloud climatology were evaluated against the available ground and satellite data. The results showed that inclusion of (NH4)(2)SO4 into McRAS-AC of the SCM made a remarkable improvement in the simulated effective radius of ice cloud particulates. However, the corresponding ice-cloud optical thickness increased even more than the observed. This can be caused by lack of horizontal cloud advection not performed in the SCM. Adjusting the other tunable parameters such as precipitation efficiency can mitigate this deficiency. Inclusion of ice cloud particle splintering invoked empirically further reduced simulation biases. Overall, these changes make a substantial improvement in simulated cloud optical properties and cloud distribution particularly over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the GCM.},

	abstract = {The current cloud thermodynamic phase discrimination by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) is based on the depolarization of backscattered light measured by its lidar [Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)]. It assumes that backscattered light from ice crystals is depolarizing, whereas water clouds, being spherical, result in minimal depolarization. However, because of the relationship between the CALIOP field of view (FOV) and the large distance between the satellite and clouds and because of the frequent presence of oriented ice crystals, there is often a weak correlation between measured depolarization and phase, which thereby creates significant uncertainties in the current CALIOP phase retrieval. For water clouds, the CALIOP-measured depolarization can be large because of multiple scattering, whereas horizontally oriented ice particles depolarize only weakly and behave similarly to water clouds. Because of the nonunique depolarization-cloud phase relationship, more constraints are necessary to uniquely determine cloud phase. Based on theoretical and modeling studies, an improved cloud phase determination algorithm has been developed. Instead of depending primarily on layer-integrated depolarization ratios, this algorithm differentiates cloud phases by using the spatial correlation of layer-integrated attenuated backscatter and layer-integrated particulate depolarization ratio. This approach includes a two-step process: 1) use of a simple two-dimensional threshold method to provide a preliminary identification of ice clouds containing randomly oriented particles, ice clouds with horizontally oriented particles, and possible water clouds and 2) application of a spatial coherence analysis technique to separate water clouds from ice clouds containing horizontally oriented ice particles. Other information, such as temperature, color ratio, and vertical variation of depolarization ratio, is also considered. The algorithm works well for both the 0.3 degrees and 3 degrees off-nadir lidar pointing geometry. When the lidar is pointed at 0.38 off nadir, half of the opaque ice clouds and about one-third of all ice clouds have a significant lidar backscatter contribution from specular reflections from horizontally oriented particles. At 3 degrees off nadir, the lidar backscatter signals for roughly 30\% of opaque ice clouds and 20\% of all observed ice clouds are contaminated by horizontally oriented crystals.},

The TMI heating algorithm (herein called TRAIN) is calibrated or "trained" using relatively accurate estimates of heating based on spaceborne Precipitation Radar (PR) observations collocated with the TMI observations over a one-month period. The heating estimation technique is based on a previously described Bayesian methodology, but with improvements in supporting cloud-resolving model simulations, an adjustment of precipitation echo tops to compensate for model biases, and a separate scaling of convective and stratiform heating components that leads to an approximate balance between estimated vertically integrated condensation and surface precipitation.Estimates of Q(1) - Q(R) from TMI compare favorably with the PR training estimates and show only modest sensitivity to the cloud-resolving model simulations of heating used to construct the training data. Moreover, the net condensation in the corresponding annual mean satellite latent heating profile is within a few percent of the annual mean surface precipitation rate over the tropical and subtropical oceans where the algorithm is applied. Comparisons of Q(1) produced by combining TMI Q(1) - Q(R) with independently derived estimates of Q(R) show reasonable agreement with rawinsonde-based analyses of Q(1) from two field campaigns, although the satellite estimates exhibit heating profile structures with sharper and more intense heating peaks than the rawinsonde estimates.},

Furthermore, it is shown that a correction for the effective temperature of the trace gas is essential and that a correction for the presence of aerosols needs to be accompanied by aerosol corrections to the cloud retrieval. A discussion of the error components and total retrieval uncertainty is given for March 1997. Tropospheric NO2 columns can be retrieved with a precision of 35 - 60\% over regions with a large contribution of the troposphere to the total column.

The performance of the new scheme is evaluated by comparing the parameterized cloud droplet number concentration with that of a detailed numerical activation cloud parcel model. The resulting modified parameterization robustly and closely tracks the parcel model simulations, even for low values of the accommodation coefficient (average error 4.1 +/- 1.3\%). The modifications to include the effect of accommodation coefficient do not increase the computational cost but substantially improve the parameterization performance.

Besides air mass temperature and updraft velocity, number concentration of pure sulfate aerosol acting through homogeneous ice nucleation and number concentration of soot aerosol as heterogeneous ice nuclei are explicitly included in the parameterization so that the indirect effect of aerosols on the cirrus clouds (i.e. the effect of increases in aerosol number concentrations) can be described in a global model. In addition the transition from the heterogeneous to homogeneous-dominated nucleation and the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation in the transition regime are considered in the parameterization.

	abstract = {[1] This study investigates the impacts of tropospheric aerosols on the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) for dry subsiding regions by conducting simulations with a high-resolution ABL model. The scattering and absorption of aerosols diminish the surface radiation, inhibiting the sensible heat flux and evaporation and inducing feedbacks such as the enhanced stratification and change in relative humidity in the surface layer. The reduced sensible heat due to aerosol backscattering lowers the air temperature and suppresses the growth of the ABL. The resultant reduction of entrainment heating contributes to an additional cooling. The decreased entrainment drying competes with the reduced surface evaporation, so that the net effect can be either an increase or a decrease of the ABL moisture, depending on the soil moisture. Aerosol absorption decreases the turbulent heating but simultaneously increases the solar heating, increasing the air temperature and decreasing the strength of capping inversion. The resultant rise of the top of the ABL compensates the lowering due to the reduced buoyancy flux. With strong aerosol absorption, the increased entrainment heating enhances the ABL warming. Both the increased entrainment drying and the reduced evaporation decrease the ABL moisture. The increased warmth and dryness of the ABL imply that absorbing aerosols within the ABL decrease the probability of formation of boundary layer clouds, causing additional warming through cloud-feedbacks. The results are sensitive to the vertical distribution of absorbing aerosols. Absorbing aerosol above the ABL increases the strength of capping inversion and reduces the top of the ABL, hence decreasing the entrainment drying and moistening the ABL.},

	abstract = {This study reports on the evolution of particle size distributions (PSDs) and habits as measured during slow, Lagrangian-type spiral descents through deep subtropical and tropical cloud layers in Florida, Brazil, and Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, most of which were precipitating. The objective of the flight patterns was to learn more about how the PSDs evolved in the vertical and to obtain information of the vertical structure of microphysical properties. New instrumentation yielding better information on the concentrations of particles in the size (D) range between 0.2 and 2 cm, as well as improved particle imagery, produced more comprehensive observations for tropical stratiform precipitation regions and anvils than have been available previously. Collocated radar observations provided additional information on the vertical structure of the cloud layers sampled.Most of the spirals began at cloud top, with temperatures (T) as low as -50degreesC, and ended at cloud base or below the melting layer (ML). The PSDs broadened from cloud top toward cloud base, with the largest particles increasing in size from several millimeters at cloud top, to 1 cm or larger toward cloud base. Some continued growth was noted in the upper part of the ML. Concentrations of particles less than 1 mm in size decreased with decreasing height. The result was a consistent change in the PSDs in the vertical. Similarly, systematic changes in the size dependence of the particle cross-sectional area was noted with decreasing height. Aggregation-as ascertained from both the changes in the PSDs and evolution of particle habits as observed in high detail with the cloud particle imager (CPI) probe-was responsible for these trends.The PSDs were generally well-represented by gamma distributions of the form N = N0GammaDmu–l-lambdaGammaD that were fitted to the PSDs over 1-km horizontal intervals throughout the spirals. The intercept (N-0Gamma), slope (lambda(Gamma)), and dispersion (mu) values were derived for each PSD. Exponential curves (N = N0(Gamma)e(-lambdaD); mu = 0) were also fitted to the distributions. The lambda(Gamma) values for given spirals varied systematically with temperature as did the values of lambda (exponential), and the data generally conformed to values found in previous studies involving exponential fits to size distributions in midlatitude frontal and cirrus layers. Considerable variability often noted in the PSD properties during the loops of individual spirals was manifested primarily in large changes in N-0Gamma and N-0, but mu, lambda(Gamma), and lambda remained fairly stable. Temperature is not found to be the sole factor controlling lambda(Gamma) or lambda, but is a primary one. Direct relationships were found between lambda(Gamma) and N-0Gamma, or lambda(Gamma) and mu, for the gamma distributions, and lambda and N-0 for the exponential. The latter relationship was not found as distinctly in earlier studies; observed PSDs in this study had better fidelity with less scatter. The mu values changed monotonically with T over the range of temperatures and were directly related to N-0Gamma or lambda(Gamma), thereby reducing the number of variables in the PSD functional equation to two. In the upper part of the ML, N-0, and lambda continued to decrease, and in the lower part these values began to increase as the largest particles melted.General expressions relating various bulk microphysical, radar, and radiative-transfer-related variables to N-0Gamma and lambda(Gamma) were developed; they are useful for both tropical and midlatitude clouds. These relationships facilitate the specification of a number of bulk properties in cloud and climate models. The results presented in this paper apply best to temperatures between 0degrees and -40degreesC, for which the measured radar reflectivities fall in the range of 0 to 25 dBZ(e).},

The global mean MLTSC occurrence was similar to 7.8\% and the global mean MLTSC percentage fraction related to all midlevel clouds was similar to 33.6\%. Strong seasonal and day-night variations of MLTSC occurrence were observed over different latitude regions. In the polar regions, the maximum occurrence was in summer, while the minimum occurred in winter, with small day-night differences. In the tropics, a high MLTSC occurrence band shifted southward from June-July-August to December-January-February with significantly more MLTSC during the nighttime. The global mean MLTSC top height and temperature were similar to 4.5 km above the surface and -13.6 degrees C. Overall, 61.8\% of MLTSCs were mixed phase and 12.4\% were supercooled liquid (contains only liquid phase or with ice below the detection limit). The fraction of mixed-phase MLTSC increased as the cloud top temperature decreased, with a sharp increase between -10 and -15 degrees C and a noticeable latitude difference. This temperature dependence indicated that ice nucleation is active at -10 degrees C in these clouds. The global mean ice water path (IWP) of mixed-phase MLTSCs, estimated based on an empirical temperature-radar reflectivity-ice water content relationship, was -13.4 g/m(2), and the IWP increased as cloud top temperature decreased. To improve MLTSC parameterizations in global climate models, further studies are needed to better understand the latitude dependence of MLTSC distributions and microphysical properties and how aerosol and water phase cloud properties affecting ice generation in MLTSCs.},

However, little is known about the impact of high-or low-latitude volcanic eruptions on tropical climate, particularly for the period preceding the instrumental record(6-9). Here we use annually resolved temperature-related records from corals, tree rings and ice cores to investigate the relationship between volcanism and low-latitude climate. Over the past 450 years, we find an association between low-latitude volcanic events and lower sea surface temperatures in the tropical oceans. The longest sustained cold period in recent centuries occurred in the early nineteenth century, following the eruption of Tambora and a second, unidentified but presumably tropical(1), volcano. We therefore conclude that the tropical ocean-atmosphere system has been sensitive to changes in radiative forcing caused by tropical volcanism over the past several centuries.},

The increase in sea surface temperature and the associated decrease in lower tropospheric stability appear to play a far more important role in cloud evolution than other factors including changes in large scale divergence and upper tropospheric humidity. During the summer months, the transitions in marine boundary layer cloudiness appear so systematically that their characteristics obtained by documenting the flow of thousands of individual air masses are well reproduced by the mean (or climatological) fields of the different data sets. This highlights interesting opportunities for future observational and modeling studies of these transitions.},

Measurements indicate that drizzle is prevalent. During five of seven analyzed flights precipitation was evident at the surface, and on roughly a third of the flights mean surface rates approached or exceeded 0.5 mm day(-1). Additional analysis of the structure and variability of drizzle indicates that the macroscopic (flight averaged) mean drizzle rates at cloud base scale with H-3/N where H is the flight-averaged cloud depth and N the flight-averaged cloud droplet number concentration. To a lesser extent flight-to-flight variability in the mean drizzle rate also scales well with differences in the 11- and 4-mum brightness temperatures, and the cloud-top effective radius. The structure of stratocumulus boundary layers with precipitation reaching the surface is also investigated, and a general picture emerges of large flight-averaged drizzle rates being manifested primarily through the emergence of intense pockets of precipitation. The characteristics of the drizzle spectrum in precipitating versus nonprecipitating regions of a particular cloud layer were mostly distinguished by the number of drizzle drops present, rather than a change in size of the median drizzle drop, or the breadth of the drizzle spectrum.},

	abstract = {The radiative and microphysical characteristics of 17 precipitating systems observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite over Manus, Papua New Guinea, and Nauru Island are modeled. These cases represent both deep and midlevel convection. Reflectivity data from the TRMM precipitation radar and Geostationary Meteorological Satellite infrared radiometer measurements are used to parameterize the three-dimensional cloud microphysics of each precipitating cloud system. These parameterized cloud properties are used as input for a two-stream radiative transfer model. Comparisons with measurements of broadband radiative fluxes at the top of atmosphere and the surface show agreement to within 20\%. In cases in which the convective available potential energy (CAPE) is large, deep convective clouds with extended anvil decks form, containing layers of ice crystals that are too small to be detected by the TRMM radar but have a large optical thickness. This results in maximum shortwave heating and longwave cooling near cloud top at heights of 12-14 km. When CAPE is small, convective clouds extend only to midlevels (4-7 km), and there are no cloud layers below the detectability limit of the TRMM radar. Radiative heating and cooling in these cases are maximum near the freezing level. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the small ice crystals near the cloud top and larger precipitation-sized particles play equally significant roles in producing the high albedos of tropical anvil clouds. A comparison of the radiative heating profiles calculated in this study with latent heating profiles from previous studies shows that for cases of mature deep convection near local solar noon, the maximum radiative heating is 10\%-30\% of the magnitude of the maximum latent heating.},

It is found that the effect of threshold representations is larger on instantaneous values than on daily averages; and the effect depends on the percentage of clouds in their transitional stages of converting cloud water to rain water. For both the instantaneous values and daily averages, the sensitivity to the specification of critical radius is more significant than the sensitivity to the 'smoothness' of the threshold representation (as embodied in the relative dispersion of droplet size distribution) for drizzling clouds. Moreover, the impact of threshold representations on the AIE is stronger than that on CF and LWP.},

	abstract = {Global tropospheric ozone distributions, budgets, and radiative forcings from an ensemble of 26 state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry models have been intercompared and synthesized as part of a wider study into both the air quality and climate roles of ozone. Results from three 2030 emissions scenarios, broadly representing "optimistic,” "likely,” and "pessimistic” options, are compared to a base year 2000 simulation. This base case realistically represents the current global distribution of tropospheric ozone. A further set of simulations considers the influence of climate change over the same time period by forcing the central emissions scenario with a surface warming of around 0.7K. The use of a large multimodel ensemble allows us to identify key areas of uncertainty and improves the robustness of the results. Ensemble mean changes in tropospheric ozone burden between 2000 and 2030 for the 3 scenarios range from a 5\% decrease, through a 6\% increase, to a 15\% increase. The intermodel uncertainty (+/-1 standard deviation) associated with these values is about +/-25\%. Model outliers have no significant influence on the ensemble mean results. Combining ozone and methane changes, the three scenarios produce radiative forcings of -50, 180, and 300 mW m(-2), compared to a CO2 forcing over the same time period of 800-1100 mW m(-2). These values indicate the importance of air pollution emissions in short-to medium-term climate forcing and the potential for stringent/lax control measures to improve/worsen future climate forcing. The model sensitivity of ozone to imposed climate change varies between models but modulates zonal mean mixing ratios by +/-5 ppbv via a variety of feedback mechanisms, in particular those involving water vapor and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. This level of climate change also reduces the methane lifetime by around 4\%. The ensemble mean year 2000 tropospheric ozone budget indicates chemical production, chemical destruction, dry deposition and stratospheric input fluxes of 5100, 4650, 1000, and 550 Tg(O-3) yr(-1), respectively. These values are significantly different to the mean budget documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR). The mean ozone burden (340 Tg(O-3)) is 10\% larger than the IPCC TAR estimate, while the mean ozone lifetime (22 days) is 10\% shorter. Results from individual models show a correlation between ozone burden and lifetime, and each model's ozone burden and lifetime respond in similar ways across the emissions scenarios. The response to climate change is much less consistent. Models show more variability in the tropics compared to midlatitudes. Some of the most uncertain areas of the models include treatments of deep tropical convection, including lightning NOx production; isoprene emissions from vegetation and isoprene's degradation chemistry; stratosphere-troposphere exchange; biomass burning; and water vapor concentrations.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of entrainment dilution on convective available potential energy (CAPE) and closure assumptions in convection parameterization using the sounding data from three Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs). It is shown that entrainment of the environmental air has a strong dilution effect on CAPE, and this effect depends on the degree of subsaturation of the entrained air: the drier the entrained air, the larger the effect. For CAPE-based closure assumptions, the dilute CAPE has a moderate correlation with convective removal of CAPE. While better than for undiluted CAPE, which is virtually uncorrelated with convective CAPE removal, this correlation is not satisfactory enough for convection closure. For quasi-equilibrium-based closures, while the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium assumption is a superior closure for convection when undiluted CAPE is used, both the Arakawa-Schubert quasi-equilibrium closure and the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium closure work well for dilute CAPE in all three IOPs studied. It is further shown from the CAPE definition and the large-scale temperature budget equation that for undiluted CAPE, the free tropospheric large-scale CAPE change and precipitation are approximately linearly related. The most important effect of entrainment dilution on CAPE and convection parameterization closure assumptions is to enhance the role of free tropospheric humidity, thereby diminishing the overwhelming role of boundary layer control on undiluted CAPE and its variation.},

	abstract = {Observation of the vertical profile of precipitation over the global Tropics is a key objective of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) because this information is central to obtaining vertical profiles of latent heating. This study combines both TRMM precipitation radar (PR) and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) data to examine "wet-season” vertical structures of tropical precipitation across a broad spectrum of locations in the global Tropics. TRMM-PR reflectivity data (2A25 algorithm) were utilized to produce seasonal mean three-dimensional relative frequency histograms and precipitation ice water contents over grid boxes of approximately 5 degrees -10 degrees in latitude and longitude. The reflectivity histograms and ice water contents were then combined with LIS lightning flash densities and 2A25 mean rainfall rates to examine regional relationships between precipitation vertical structure, precipitation processes, and lightning production.Analysis of the reflectivity vertical structure histograms and lightning flash density data reveals that 1) relative to tropical continental locations, wet-season isolated tropical oceanic locations exhibit relatively little spatial (and in some instances seasonal) variability in vertical structure across the global Tropics; 2) coastal locations and areas located within 500-1000 km of a continent exhibit considerable seasonal and spatial variability in mean vertical structure, often resembling "continental” profiles or falling intermediate to that of tropical continental and isolated oceanic regimes; and 3) interior tropical continental locations exhibit marked variability in vertical structure both spatially and seasonally, exhibiting a continuum of characteristics ranging from a near-isolated oceanic profile observed over the central Amazon and India to a more robust continental profile observed over regions such as the Congo and Florida. Examination of regional and seasonal mean conditional instability for a small but representative subset of the geographic locations suggests that tropospheric thermodynamic structure likely plays a significant role in the regional characteristics of precipitation vertical structure and associated lightning flash density.In general, the largest systematic variability in precipitation vertical structure observed between all of the locations examined occurred above the freezing level. It is important that subfreezing temperature variability in the vertical reflectivity structures was well reflected in the seasonal mean lightning flash densities and ice water contents diagnosed for each location. In turn, systematically larger rainfall rates were observed on a pixel-by-pixel basis in locations with larger precipitation ice water content and lightning flash density. These results delineate, in a regional sense, the relative importance of mixed-phase precipitation production across the global Tropics.},

	abstract = {[1] This paper describes a modified formulation of stratiform condensation rate associated with fractional cloudiness in the Community Atmospheric Model Version 2 (CAM2). It introduces an equation to link cloudiness change with the variation of total condensate. Together with a diagnostic cloud relationship that represents subgrid-scale variability of relative humidity, a closed system is formed to calculate the fractional condensation rate. As a result, the new formulation eliminates the two closure assumptions in the Rasch and Kristjansson [1998] prognostic cloud scheme. It also extends the Sundqvist [1978] scheme by including the influence of convective detrainment and advection of condensates on the fractional cloudiness. Comparison is made between the present formulation and the Rasch and Kristjansson scheme by using data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program and through global model simulations with CAM2. It is shown that relative to the Rasch and Kristjansson scheme, the new formulation produces less clouds and a slightly warmer troposphere, thus reducing the original cold bias in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM). Even though the overall impact of the new formulation on the model climate is small, the modifications lead to more consistent treatments of fractional cloudiness change, condensation rate, and cloud water change in the model.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations that incorporate a size-resolving representation of cloud water are used to study the effect of heavy drizzle on PBL structure. Simulated surface precipitation rates average about 1 mm day(-1). Heavily drizzling simulations are compared to nondrizzling simulations under two nocturnal PBL regimes-one primarily driven by buoyancy and the other driven equally by buoyancy and shear. Drizzle implies a net latent heating in the cloud that leads to sharp reductions in both entrainment and the production of turbulent kinetic energy by buoyancy (particularly in downdrafts). Drizzle, which evaporates below cloud base, promotes a cooler and moister subcloud layer that further inhibits deep mixing. The cooling and moistening is in quantitative agreement with some observations and is shown to favor the formation of cumuli rising out of the subcloud layer. The cumuli, which are local in space and time, are responsible for most of the heat and moisture transport. They also appear to generate a larger-scale circulation that differs dramatically from the regularity typically found in nonprecipitating stratocumulus. Time-averaged turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture increase in the presence of precipitation, suggesting that drizzle (and drizzle-induced stratification) should not necessarily be taken as a sign of decoupling. Because drizzle primarily affects the vertical distribution of buoyancy, shear production of turbulent kinetic energy mitigates some of the effects described above. Based on large-eddy simulation the authors hypothesize that shallow, well-mixed, radiatively driven stratocumulus cannot persist in the presence of heavy drizzle. In accord with some simpler models, the simulated case with heavy precipitation promotes a reduction in both liquid-water path and entrainment. However, the simulations suggest that time-integrated cloud fraction may increase as a result of drizzle because thinner precipitating clouds may persist longer if the boundary layer does not deepen as rapidly. These somewhat more complicated dynamics have important implications for a number of hypotheses suggesting that changes in aerosol concentrations, when metabolized by stratocumulus, have a significant effect on climate.},

This allows us to follow the evolution of nitrogen from each source without affecting the overall chemical system of the atmosphere. The model results suggest that the NOx concentration in the southern hemisphere is mostly dominated by the lightning source, while the northern hemisphere odd nitrogen burden results mainly from the influence of fossil fuel combustion, aircraft, and lightning emissions. In particular, in the upper tropospheric northern hemisphere midlatitudes, approximately 25-30\% of the NOx is due to aircraft, 15-20\% to fossil fuel combustion sources at the surface, and 15-20\% to lightning, assuming that the global fleet of aircraft releases 0.44 TgN/yr and that lightning produces 5 TgN/yr. The sensitivity of these figures to several parameters (aircraft and soil source strengths, as well as the lightning source strength and its vertical distribution) is also studied.},

In agreement with a prior study by Ackerman et al. (2004), sedimentation is found to decrease entrainment rate and thereby increase liquid water path. They suggested this is due to reduction of boundary-layer turbulence. Our simulations suggest otherwise. Instead, sedimentation reduces entrainment by removing liquid water from the entrainment zone. This inhibits two mechanisms that promote the sinking of entrained air into the cloud layer entrainment-induced evaporative cooling and longwave radiative cooling. A sensitivity study shows that the radiative effect is less important than the reduced evaporation. A possible parameterization of the effect of sedimentation on entrainment rate in a mixed layer model is proposed and tested. Since the droplet sedimentation rate is inversely related to cloud droplet (and presumably aerosol) concentration and nearly nondrizzling marine stratocumulus are widespread, sedimentation impacts on stratocumulus entrainment efficiency should be considered in climate model simulations of the aerosol indirect effect.},

	abstract = {The role of drop collision-coalescence as a means of reducing drop number concentrations, and hence cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) concentrations as these are cycled in the stratocumulus-capped marine boundary layer, is investigated. We focus on the impact of this process on the mass-mean size of CCN in the absence of wet deposition, and compare this mechanism with size changes resulting from mass addition through aqueous chemistry. The modeling framework is a two-dimensional eddy-resolving model that includes explicit treatment of aerosol and drop spectra, as well as the solute transfer between drop size bins. The microphysical processes considered are droplet activation, condensation/evaporation, collision-coalescence, sedimentation and regeneration of particles following complete evaporation. It is shown that for a case exhibiting negligible-wet deposition, collision-coalescence can significantly reduce drop concentrations (22\% h(-1)) resulting in a measurable increase In particle mass-mean radius of about 7\% h(-1). In order to extend the validity of these results, trajectory analyses of parcel in-cloud residence times have been used together with box model calculations of collision-coalescence to explore the parameters affecting processing through collision-coalescence. This trajectory information is also used to deduce the extent of in-cloud conversion of SO2 to sulfate. Comparisons show that the two mechanisms may produce comparable rates of increase in the mean particle size under certain conditions. Results for remote marine conditions suggest that aqueous phase chemistry may have a greater impact at lower cloud liquid-water contents, whereas collision-coalescence may dominate at higher liquid-water contents, or for broader drop spectra.},

	abstract = {A total of 98 three-dimensional large-eddy simulations ( LESs) of marine stratocumulus clouds covering both nighttime and daytime conditions were performed to explore the response of cloud optical depth ( tau) to various aerosol number concentrations ( N-a = 50-2500 cm(-3)) and the covarying meteorological conditions ( large-scale divergence rate and SST). The idealized First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project ( ISCCP) Regional Experiment ( FIRE) and the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment ( ASTEX) Lagrangian 1 sounding profiles were used to represent the lightly and heavily drizzling cases, respectively. The first and second aerosol indirect effects are identified. Through statistical analysis, tau is found be to both positively correlated with Na and cloud liquid water path ( LWP) with a higher correlation associated with LWP, which is predominantly regulated by large-scale subsidence and SST. Clouds with high LWP occur under low SST or weak large-scale subsidence. Introduction of a small amount of giant sea salt aerosol into the simulation lowers the number of cloud droplets activated, results in larger cloud droplets, and initiates precipitation for nondrizzling polluted clouds or precedes the precipitation process for drizzling clouds. However, giant sea salt aerosol is found to have a negligible effect on tau for lightly precipitating cases, while resulting in a relative reduction of tau of 3\%-77\% ( increasing with N-a, for N-a = 1000-2500 cm(-3)) for heavily precipitating cases, suggesting that the impact of giant sea salt is only important for moist and potentially convective clouds. Finally, a regression analysis of the simulations shows that the second indirect effect is more evident in clear than polluted cases. The second indirect effect is found to enhance ( reduce) the overall aerosol indirect effect for heavily ( lightly) drizzling clouds; that is, tau is larger ( smaller) for the same relative change in Na than considering the Twomey ( first indirect) effect alone. The aerosol indirect effect ( on tau) is lessened in the daytime afternoon conditions and is dominated by the Twomey effect; however, the effect in the early morning is close but slightly smaller than that in the nocturnal run. Diurnal variations of the aerosol indirect effect should be considered to accurately assess its magnitude.},

Another possible explanation, however, is that the history of meteorological forcing controls both AOD and cloud fraction. The present study examines the latter hypothesis by comparing meteorological conditions along parcel back- trajectories for cases of large and small AOD and cloud fraction. Cloud and aerosol observations are obtained from the MODIS instrument aboard Terra, and meteorological information is obtained from ECMWF analyses. For continuity with previous investigations, the analysis focuses on the stratocumulus cloud region of the Northeast Atlantic during June through August 2002, the season of maximum cloud cover. Results show that scenes with large AOD and large cloud fraction had origins closer to Europe and experienced greater lower tropospheric static stability ( LTS) during the past 2 - 3 days than did scenes with small AOD and small cloud fraction. Controlling for variations in LTS reduces the dependence of cloud fraction on AOD by at least 54\%. We conclude that meteorological forcing must be accounted for in assessing aerosol impacts on cloud forcing, and that doing so requires a Lagrangian analysis of parcel histories.},

	abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects continue to constitute one of the most important uncertainties for anthropogenic climate perturbations. Within the international AEROCOM initiative, the representation of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in ten different general circulation models (GCMs) is evaluated using three satellite datasets. The focus is on stratiform liquid water clouds since most GCMs do not include ice nucleation effects, and none of the model explicitly parameterises aerosol effects on convective clouds. We compute statistical relationships between aerosol optical depth (tau(a)) and various cloud and radiation quantities in a manner that is consistent between the models and the satellite data. It is found that the model-simulated influence of aerosols on cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) compares relatively well to the satellite data at least over the ocean. The relationship between tau(a) and liquid water path is simulated much too strongly by the models. This suggests that the implementation of the second aerosol indirect effect mainly in terms of an autoconversion parameterisation has to be revisited in the GCMs. A positive relationship between total cloud fraction (f(cld)) and tau(a) as found in the satellite data is simulated by the majority of the models, albeit less strongly than that in the satellite data in most of them. In a discussion of the hypotheses proposed in the literature to explain the satellite-derived strong f(cld)-tau(a) relationship, our results indicate that none can be identified as a unique explanation. Relationships similar to the ones found in satellite data between tau(a) and cloud top temperature or outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) are simulated by only a few GCMs. The GCMs that simulate a negative OLR-tau(a) relationship show a strong positive correlation between tau(a) and f(cld). The short-wave total aerosol radiative forcing as simulated by the GCMs is strongly influenced by the simulated anthropogenic fraction of tau(a), and parameterisation assumptions such as a lower bound on N-d. Nevertheless, the strengths of the statistical relationships are good predictors for the aerosol forcings in the models. An estimate of the total short-wave aerosol forcing inferred from the combination of these predictors for the modelled forcings with the satellite-derived statistical relationships yields a global annual mean value of -1.5 +/- 0.5 Wm(-2). In an alternative approach, the radiative flux perturbation due to anthropogenic aerosols can be broken down into a component over the cloud-free portion of the globe (approximately the aerosol direct effect) and a component over the cloudy portion of the globe (approximately the aerosol indirect effect). An estimate obtained by scaling these simulated clear- and cloudy-sky forcings with estimates of anthropogenic tau(a) and satellite-retrieved N-d-tau(a) regression slopes, respectively, yields a global, annual-mean aerosol direct effect estimate of -0.4 +/- 0.2 Wm(-2) and a cloudy-sky (aerosol indirect effect) estimate of -0.7 +/- 0.5 Wm(-2), with a total estimate of -1.2 +/- 0.4 Wm(-2).},

	abstract = {The impact of aerosols on precipitation occurrence in warm clouds is assessed using a combination of multisensor satellite cloud and precipitation data sets and aerosol information from both satellite and a global transport model. Aerosols are found to suppress the formation of precipitation in polluted regions, evidenced by a trend toward higher liquid water path prior to the onset of light rainfall. Polluted clouds are also found to be more vertically developed than those in more pristine environments. Coupled with an apparent reduction in the size of the raindrops that subsequently form in these clouds, these findings indicate that pollution inhibits precipitation processes by redistributing water among a greater number of smaller cloud droplets. Evidence is also provided that sea-salt aerosols have the opposite effect on precipitation development. Maritime clouds that form in regions of enhanced sea-salt concentrations tend to precipitate more frequently, form larger raindrops, and be less vertically developed. This suggests that the nucleation of sea-salt particles may provide a source of embryonic raindrops in maritime clouds accelerating precipitation processes and ultimately reducing cloud lifetime. The net effect of aerosols on the onset of precipitation in any given region is, therefore, defined by the relative magnitudes of the competing effects of sulfate aerosols and sea-salt particles, the strengths of which depend strongly on both cloud liquid water path and the thermodynamic properties of the local environment.},

	abstract = {The importance of macrophysical variables [cloud thickness, liquid water path (LWP)] and microphysical variables (effective radius r(e), effective droplet concentration N-eff) on warm drizzle intensity and frequency across the tropics and subtropics is studied. In this first part of a two-part study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical and CloudSat cloud radar data are used to understand warm rain in marine clouds. Part 11 uses simple heuristic models. Cloud-top height and LWP substantially increase as drizzle intensity increases. Droplet radius estimated from MODIS also increases with cloud radar reflectivity (dBZ) but levels off as dBZ {\textgreater} 0, except where the influence of continental pollution is present, in which case a monotonic increase of r(e) with drizzle intensity occurs. Off the Asian coast and over the Gulf of Mexico, r(e) values are smaller (by several mu m) and N-eff values are larger compared to more remote marine regions. For heavy drizzle intensity, both r(e) and N-eff values off the Asian coast and over the Gulf of Mexico approach r(e) and N-eff values in more remote marine regions. Drizzle frequency, defined as profiles in which maximum dBZ {\textgreater} -15, increases dramatically and nearly uniformly when cloud tops grow from 1 to 2 km.Drizzle frequencies exceed 90\% in all regions when LWPs exceed 250 g m(-2) and N-eff values are below 50 cm(-3), even in regions where drizzle occurs infrequently on the whole. The fact that the relationship among drizzle frequency, LWP, and N-eff is essentially the same for all regions suggests a near universality among tropical and subtropical regions.},

In this study the 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud optical depth and surface reflectance datasets are used to compute the 3-D radiation fields with ambient aerosol optical thickness of 0.1 at a wavelength of 0.66 mu m. The 3-D radiative effects range from -0.015 to 0.018 with an average of 0.004 and standard deviation of 0.006. The 3-D effects are most pronounced and variable for cloud neighboring pixels, where both large negative effects over shadows and positive effects near sunlit cloud edges are found. The clear next-to-cloud pixels, that contain similar to 83\% of the clear pixel population, are affected in the most complex way and not reliable for aerosol retrieval. In the area 2 km away from clouds, the 3-D effects enhance the reflectance in clear patches. The average and variability of enhancements gradually decrease as a function of the cloud-free distance, resulting in a systematically higher aerosol optical depth estimates for pixels closer to clouds in one-dimensional (1-D) retrieval. At a distance of 3 km away from clouds, the 3-D effect is still appreciable with the average enhancement slightly less than 0.004. This enhancement will lead to an over estimate of aerosol optical thickness of similar to 0.04 in 1-D retrieval, which is significant for an ambient atmosphere with aerosol optical thickness of 0.1.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effects of aerosol on clouds, precipitation, and the organization of trade wind cumuli using large eddy simulations (LES). Results show that for this shallow-cumulus-under-stratocumulus case, cloud fraction increases with increasing aerosol as the aerosol number mixing ratio increases from 25 (domain-averaged surface precipitation rate similar to 0.65 mm day(-1)) to 100 mg(-1) (negligible surface precipitation). Further increases in aerosol result in a reduction in cloud fraction. It is suggested that opposing influences of aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation and aerosol-induced enhancement of evaporation are responsible for this nonmonotonic behavior. Under clean conditions (25 mg(-1)), drizzle is shown to initiate and maintain mesoscale organization of cumulus convection. Precipitation induces downdrafts and cold pool outflow as the cumulus cell develops. At the surface, the center of the cell is characterized by a divergence field, while the edges of the cell are zones of convergence. Convergence drives the formation and development of new cloud cells, leading to a mesoscale open cellular structure. These zones of new cloud formation generate new precipitation zones that continue to reinforce the cellular structure. For simulations with an aerosol concentration of 100 mg(-1) the cloud fields do not show any cellular organization. On average, no evidence is found for aerosol effects on the lifetime of these clouds, suggesting that cloud fraction response to changes in aerosol is tied to the frequency of convection and/or cloud size.},

	abstract = {[1] We interpret the distribution of tropical tropospheric ozone columns (TTOCs) from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) by using a global three-dimensional model of tropospheric chemistry (GEOS-CHEM) and additional information from in situ observations. The GEOS-CHEM TTOCs capture 44\% of the variance of monthly mean TOMS TTOCs from the convective cloud differential method (CCD) with no global bias. Major discrepancies are found over northern Africa and south Asia where the TOMS TTOCs do not capture the seasonal enhancements from biomass burning found in the model and in aircraft observations. A characteristic feature of these northern tropical enhancements, in contrast to southern tropical enhancements, is that they are driven by the lower troposphere where the sensitivity of TOMS is poor due to Rayleigh scattering. We develop an efficiency correction to the TOMS retrieval algorithm that accounts for the variability of ozone in the lower troposphere. This efficiency correction increases TTOCs over biomass burning regions by 3-5 Dobson units (DU) and decreases them by 2-5 DU over oceanic regions, improving the agreement between CCD TTOCs and in situ observations. Applying the correction to CCD TTOCs reduces by similar to5 DU the magnitude of the "tropical Atlantic paradox” [Thompson et al., 2000], i.e. the presence of a TTOC enhancement over the southern tropical Atlantic during the northern African biomass burning season in December-February. We reproduce the remainder of the paradox in the model and explain it by the combination of upper tropospheric ozone production from lightning NOx, persistent subsidence over the southern tropical Atlantic as part of the Walker circulation, and cross-equatorial transport of upper tropospheric ozone from northern midlatitudes in the African "westerly duct. ” These processes in the model can also account for the observed 13-17 DU persistent wave-1 pattern in TTOCs with a maximum over the tropical Atlantic and a minimum over the tropical Pacific during all seasons. The photochemical effects of mineral dust have only a minor role on the modeled distribution of TTOCs, including over northern Africa, due to multiple competing effects. The photochemical effects of mineral dust globally decrease annual mean OH concentrations by 9\%. A global lightning NOx source of 6 Tg N yr(-1) in the model produces a simulation that is most consistent with TOMS and in situ observations.},

	abstract = {To determine conditions over the Indian Ocean, under which cloud fields are most susceptible to modification from aerosols, and to study how turbulent activities and shallow cumuli vary for different meteorological scenarios, a three-dimensional large-eddy simulation model was initialized using data collected during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). Radiosonde data were used to construct six soundings encompassing the range of temperature and humidity observed. A total of 18 meteorological scenarios were then obtained by adding either an average transition layer (TL), a strong inversion layer (IL), or no stable layer to each sounding. Separate simulations were conducted for each scenario assuming pristine or polluted conditions as observed during INDOEX. For aerosol profiles measured during INDOEX, aerosol semidirect effects always dominated indirect effects, with the positive daytime net indirect forcing (semidirect plus indirect forcings) varying between 0.2 and 4.5 W m(-2). Anthropogenic aerosols had a larger net indirect forcing when the environmental relative humidity (RH) was higher and in the absence of the IL and TL. Changes in meteorological factors had larger impacts on the cloud properties than did anthropogenic aerosols, indicating large uncertainties can be introduced when solely using observations to quantify aerosol effects without examining their meteorological context. Because mean lateral detrainment and entrainment rates depended on RH, aerosols, and the presence of stable layers, mass-flux parameterizations in climate models should not use single values for such rates that may not represent the range of conditions observed where trade cumuli form.},

	abstract = {Over geologic timescales, CO2 is emitted from the Earth's interior and is removed from the atmosphere by silicate rock weathering and organic carbon burial. This balance is thought to have stabilized greenhouse conditions within a range that ensured habitable conditions(1). Changes in this balance have been attributed to changes in topographic relief, where varying rates of continental rock weathering and erosion(1,2) are superimposed on fluctuations in organic carbon burial(3). Geological strata provide an indirect yet imperfectly preserved record of this change through changing rates of sedimentation(1,2,4). Widespread observations of a recent (0-5-Myr) fourfold increase in global sedimentation rates require a global mechanism to explain them(4-6). Accelerated uplift and global cooling have been given as possible causes(2,4,6,7), but because of the links between rates of erosion and the correlated rate of weathering(8,9), an increase in the drawdown of CO2 that is predicted to follow may be the cause of global climate change instead(2). However, globally, rates of uplift cannot increase everywhere in the way that apparent sedimentation rates do(4,10). Moreover, proxy records of past atmospheric CO2 provide no evidence for this large reduction in recent CO2 concentrations(11,12). Here we question whether this increase in global weathering and erosion actually occurred and whether the apparent increase in the sedimentation rate is due to observational biases in the sedimentary record(13). As evidence, we recast the ocean dissolved Be-10/Be-9 isotope system as a weathering proxy spanning the past similar to 12 Myr (ref. 14). This proxy indicates stable weathering fluxes during the late-Cenozoic era. The sum of these observations shows neither clear evidence for increased erosion nor clear evidence for a pulse in weathered material to the ocean. We conclude that processes different from an increase in denudation caused Cenozoic global cooling, and that global cooling had no profound effect on spatially and temporally averaged weathering rates.},

The susceptibility estimates are based on expanded definitions presented in a companion paper and include relative cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) changes, perturbations in cloud droplet asymmetry parameter and single-scattering albedo, atmospheric/surface effects, and incorporation of the full solar spectrum. The cloud properties (optical thickness and effective radius) used as input in the susceptibility calculations come from MODIS Terra and Aqua Collection 5 gridded data. Geographical distributions of susceptibility corresponding to absolute ("absolute cloud susceptibility”) and relative ("relative cloud susceptibility”) CDNC changes are markedly different indicating that the detailed nature of the cloud microphysical perturbation is important for determining the radiative forcing associated with the first indirect aerosol effect. However, both types of susceptibility exhibit common characteristics such as significant reductions when perturbations in single- scattering properties are omitted, significant increases when atmospheric absorption and surface albedo effects are ignored, and the tendency to decrease with latitude, to be higher over ocean than over land, and to be statistically similar between the morning and afternoon MODIS overpasses. The satellite-based susceptibility analysis helps elucidate the role of present-day cloud and land surface properties in indirect aerosol forcing responses. Our realistic yet moderate CDNC perturbations yield forcings on the order of 1-2 W m(-2) for cloud optical property distributions and land surface spectral albedos observed by MODIS. Since susceptibilities can potentially be computed from model fields, these results have practical application in assessing the reasonableness of model-generated estimates of the aerosol indirect radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Electrification and lightning are simulated for a small continental multicell storm. The results are consistent with observations and thus provide additional understanding of the charging processes and evolution of this storm. The first six observed lightning flashes were all negative cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes, after which intracloud (IC) flashes also occurred between middle and upper levels of the storm. The model simulation reproduces the basic evolution of lightning from low and middle levels to upper levels. The observed lightning indicated an initial charge structure of at least an inverted dipole (negative charge above positive). The simulations show that noninductive charge separation higher in the storm can enhance the main negative charge sufficiently to produce negative CG flashes before upper-level IC flashes commence. The result is a "bottom-heavy” tripole charge structure with midlevel negative charge and a lower positive charge region that is more significant than the upper positive region, in contrast to the traditional tripole structure that has a less significant lower positive charge region. Additionally, the occurrence of cloud-to-ground lightning is not necessarily a result of excess net charge carried by the storm, but it is primarily caused by the local potential imbalance between the lowest charge regions.The two-moment microphysics scheme used for this study predicted mass mixing ratio and number concentration of cloud droplets, rain, ice crystals, snow, and graupel. Bulk particle density of graupel was also predicted, which allows a single category to represent a greater range of particle characteristics. (An additional hail category is available but was not needed for the present study.) The prediction of hydrometeor number concentration is particularly critical for charge separation at higher temperatures (-5 degrees {\textless} T {\textless} 22 degrees C) in the mixed phase region, where ice crystals are produced by rime fracturing (Hallett-Mossop process) and by splintering of freezing drops. Cloud droplet concentration prediction also affected the rates of inductive charge separation between graupel and droplets.},

	abstract = {A new equilibrium model for shallow-cumulus-topped mixed layers is presented. A variant on the w (*) closure for the shallow-cumulus mass flux is applied that retains the convective area-fraction in its formulation. As opposed to being constant, the fraction is explicitly modeled using a statistical closure as a function of the saturation deficit and humidity variance at cloud base. As a consequence, important new interactions are introduced between the convective transport, humidity, and depth of the mixed layer. This mechanism, which we call the mass-flux humidity feedback, helps determine the character of the equilibrium state such that the mixed-layer top is maintained close to the cloud-base height. Due to the strong sensitivity of the mass flux to the area fraction, the latter thus acts as a regulator or valve mechanism on moist convective transport. As a consequence, the mixed-layer model is able to explain the robustness of many aspects of the shallow-cumulus boundary layer that is typically found in observations and large-eddy simulations (LESs). The model is evaluated for a single-LES case as well as for global climatology obtained from a 40-year reanalysis of meteorological data by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). LES characteristics of convective mass flux, cloud fraction, humidity variance, cloud-base height, and surface fluxes of heat and humidity are reproduced. The solution on reanalysis fields reproduces the spatial structure of mixed-layer temperature and humidity and their associated surface fluxes in the subtropical Atlantic and Pacific trade wind regions. Furthermore, the spatial structure of the convective area-fraction matches that of synoptic surface observations of frequency of occurrence of shallow cumulus. Particularly striking is the smooth onset of the convective area-fraction and mass flux along the trade-wind trajectory that is reproduced, from zero to typical trade-wind values. The cumulus onset represents the necessity for shallow-cumulus mass flux to occur in order to close the mixed-layer budgets of heat, moisture, and mass, as a response to the changing magnitude of large-scale subsidence and free tropospheric humidity along the trajectory. Finally, the mass flux model is implemented in an intermediate-complexity tropical climate model to study its behavior when fully interactive with the larger-scale flow. A climate run then shows that the model is stable, due to the mass-flux humidity feedback acting to keep the shallow-cumulus boundary layer close to its equilibrium state for long, climatological timescales.},

Several comparison studies have been performed on the previous and current retrieval algorithms: some involving tests of the algorithms on simulated radar data (based on actual cloud probe data or cloud resolving models) and others featuring statistical comparisons of the R04 2B-CWC-RO product (current algorithm) to ice cloud mass retrievals by other spaceborne, airborne, and ground- based instruments or alternative algorithms using the same CloudSat radar data. Comparisons involving simulated radar data based on a database of cloud probe data showed generally good performance, with ice water content (IWC) bias errors estimated to be less than 40\%. Comparisons to ice water content and ice water path estimates by other instruments are mixed. When the comparison is restricted to different retrieval approaches using the same CloudSat radar measurements, CloudSat R04 results generally agree with alternative IWC retrievals for IWC {\textless} 1000 mg m(-3) at altitudes below 12 km but differ at higher ice contents and altitudes, either exceeding other retrievals or falling within a spread of retrieval values. Validation and reconciliation of all these approaches will continue to be a topic for further research.},

	abstract = {[1] Model simulations of tropospheric O-3 require an accurate specification of the reactive odd nitrogen (NOx) source from lightning that is consistent in time and space with convective transport of O-3 precursors. Lightning NOx production in global models is often parameterized in terms of convective cloud top heights (CLDHT). However, a closer relationship may exist between flash rate and other measures of convective intensity. In this study, flash rates are parameterized in terms of CLDHT, convective precipitation (PRECON), and upward convective mass flux (MFLUX) from the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System (GEOS DAS). GEOS-based flash rates are compared to flash rates from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and Long Range Flash (LRF) network and the Optical Transient Detector (OTD). Overall, MFLUX-based flash rates are most realistic. PRECON- and CLDHT-based flash rates are too large in the tropics. The MFLUX- and PRECON- based flash rates are a factor of 3 too high (low) over the equatorial western Pacific (central and southern Africa), while CLDHT-based flash rates are much too low at nearly all marine locations. In many cases, biases in the flash rate distributions can be traced to biases in the GEOS DAS convective fields. Improvements in flash rate parameterizations will be tied closely to improvements in model physics as well as to increases in the amount of tropical data that are available for assimilation. Flash rates calculated from the 6-hour averaged CLDHTs are much less variable than observed, and O-3 production rates calculated using the NOx produced from these flash rates are likely to be larger than observed.},

In these analytical models cloud fields are assumed to occur on a semiregular grid of cells (which can be vaguely interpreted as atmospheric convective cells). In a simple, discrete cell model, cell size is fixed and each cell can either be completely filled with cloud with some probability or remain empty. Extending the discrete model to a continuous case provides more realism by allowing arbitrary cloud and gap sizes. Here the continuous cellular model is tested by comparing its statistics with those from large-eddy simulations (LES) of marine boundary layer clouds based on case studies from three trade-cumulus field projects. The statistics largely agree with some differences in small sizes approaching the LES model grid spacing. Exponential chord-length distributions follow from the assumption that the probability of any cell being cloudy is constant, appropriate for a given meteorological state (narrow sampling). Relaxing that assumption, and instead allowing this probability to have its own distribution, leads to a power-law distribution of chord lengths, appropriate to a broader sample of meteorological states (diverse sampling).},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of observational domain size and pixel resolution on the statistics of macrophysical properties of trade wind cumulus clouds over the tropical western Atlantic. In order to better facilitate comparison with model simulations, the results are presented as an extension of earlier work by Zhao and Di Girolamo (2007), who have analyzed 152 Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) scenes collected between September and December 2004 to generate comprehensive statistics of cumulus clouds at the original 60 km x 60 km domain and 15 m pixel resolution of the data. The statistics change with domain size because as the domain size becomes smaller, (1) the probability of chopping clouds by the domain boundaries into smaller clouds increases, and (2) the probability of having cloudier and clearer domains increases. In addition, degrading pixel resolution results in (1) an amalgamation of smaller clouds into larger clouds, and (2) an increase in the frequency of partially filled cloudy pixels. The mean cloud fraction in our ASTER data set increases more than fourfold, with the total number of clouds reducing 26-fold, when pixel resolution degrades from 15 m to similar to 1 km. The cloud fraction frequency distribution becomes wider with a shift of the peak toward higher values at coarser resolution. However, at smaller domain sizes, the shift of the peak toward larger values due to pixel effects is overcompensated by the increase in frequency of smaller cloud fractions. The change in cloud size distribution is significant at domains smaller than 10 km x 10 km. An increase in the cloud size at coarser resolution shifts the peak of the size distribution toward larger values. At 15 m resolution, 98\% of clouds are distributed at distances less than 300 m, with a peak in the nearest-neighbor distance at less than 50 m at all domain sizes. The peak of the nearest-neighbor distribution becomes wider and shifts to larger distances at coarser resolution. These results clearly indicate the importance of considering scale effect when comparing cloud resolving model simulations of trade wind cumuli with observations.},

Sondes from the cruise and Ascension Island (8S, 14.5W), as well as the Earth-Probe (EP)/TOMS satellite instrument, show elevated tropospheric ozone ({\textgreater} 35 Dobson Units) throughout the south Atlantic in January 1999. Ozone layers associated with biomass burning north of the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone) are prominent at 0-5 km from 10-0N, but even higher ozone (100 ppbv, 5-15 km) occurred south of the ITCZ, where it was not burning - an ozone "paradox" that contributes to a wave-one zonal pattern in tropospheric ozone. Back trajectories, satellite observations and shipboard tracers suggest that the south Atlantic ozone results from a combination of interhemispheric transport, aged stratospheric-upper tropospheric air, and possibly from ozone supplied by lightning nitric oxide.},

Two closely related classes of these critical phenomena are considered, namely, structural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in cooperative models on networks as substrates. Systems where a network and interacting agents on it influence each other are also discussed. A wide range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation, phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks are mentioned.

	abstract = {The development of a tropical cyclone from a pre-existing, weak, warm-core vortex is investigated with high-resolution cloud-resolving simulations using the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF). The simulation design and initial conditions are quite favourable for tropical cyclogenesis: the environment has a tropical sounding with no mean wind or wind shear, and the sea-surface temperature is held constant at 29 degrees C. Nonetheless, it is found that sporadic convection must occur for 48 to 72 hours before genesis and rapid intensification begins.During this time, before intensification, the vortex is found to go through important structural changes in both its wind field and its thermodynamics. While the low-level wind field decays due to friction, the inner core slowly becomes humidified due to moist detrainment and precipitation from deep convective towers. As the relative humidity in the core exceeds values of 80 per cent over most of the depth of the troposphere, a mid-level vortex forms, contracts and intensifies. Once the mid-level vortex has reached a sufficient strength, and the inner core is nearly saturated, a smaller scale vortex forms very rapidly at the surface. This smaller vortex becomes the core of an intensifying tropical cyclone.This process is explored through careful study of the inner-core dynamics and thermodynamics, with close attention paid to the changes in the moist convection as the inner core approaches saturation. While the frequency of deeper and stronger updraughts increases with time, the frequency of cool downdraughts remains essentially unchanged. In the hours before genesis, the intensification of the mid-level vortex leads to a large increase in the efficiency of the conversion of latent heat energy to the kinetic energy of the cyclonic wind field. The relative importances of the mid-level vortex and inner-core saturation are illustrated with additional simulations with different initial conditions and environmental soundings. Implications of these results for identifying and forecasting tropical cyclogenesis are discussed.},

The goal is to uncover useful information with application to radiative transfer simulation and satellite remote sensing. In fields of small cumulus clouds, size distributions are found to decrease in number with increasing diameter according to a double power law relation, often with a clear break diameter. Fractal dimensions corresponding to the horizontal area and perimeter of the clouds are greater for the larger clouds th;tn for the smaller clouds, with the same break diameter as the size distributions, meaning that the larger clouds have more ragged perimeters. These two results suggest a characteristic horizontal length scale dividing larger and smaller boundary layer cumuli. Spatial distributions show a clear tendency toward clustering. Smaller cumuli appear to grow upward more quickly with increasing horizontal size than do larger cumuli. Albedo is found to increase with greater cloud fraction and higher solar zenith angle. Even sparse fields of small cumulus cause significant shortwave forcing at the ocean surface. Simulation suggests that small cumulus may introduce significant errors into sea surface temperature retrievals and that such clouds can be difficult to remove with operational cloud-filtering schemes. Clouds smaller than about 1 km in diameter are not seen to precipitate.},

	abstract = {The interplay between clouds and aerosols and their contribution to the radiation budget is one of the largest uncertainties of climate change. Most work to date has separated cloudy and cloud-free areas in order to evaluate the individual radiative forcing of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol effects on clouds.Here we examine the size distribution and the optical properties of small, sparse cumulus clouds and the associated optical properties of what is considered a cloud-free atmosphere within the cloud field. We show that any separation between clouds and cloud free atmosphere will incur errors in the calculated radiative forcing.The nature of small cumulus cloud size distributions suggests that at any resolution, a significant fraction of the clouds are missed, and their optical properties are relegated to the apparent cloud-free optical properties. At the same time, the cloudy portion incorporates significant contribution from non-cloudy pixels.We show that the largest contribution to the total cloud reflectance comes from the smallest clouds and that the spatial resolution changes the apparent energy flux of a broken cloudy scene. When changing the resolution from 30 m to 1 km (Landsat to MODIS) the average 'cloud-free' reflectance at 1.65 mu m increases from 0.0095 to 0.0115 ({\textgreater}20\%), the cloud reflectance decreases from 0.13 to 0.066 (similar to 50\%), and the cloud coverage doubles, resulting in an important impact on climate forcing estimations. The apparent aerosol forcing is on the order of 0.5 to 1 Wm(-2) per cloud field.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous or spatially extended populations(1-4). Here we generalize population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process(3), is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution on random and scale-free networks(5-7). We determine the fixation probability of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour is identical to that of a homogeneous population(7). Furthermore, some graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection. It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely on the structure of the underlying graph. Evolutionary graph theory has many fascinating applications ranging from ecology to multi-cellular organization and economics.},

	abstract = {Synoptic surface cloud observations primarily made by volunteer observing ships are used to construct global climatologies of the frequency of occurrence of individual low cloud types over the ocean for daytime during summer and winter seasons for the time period 1954-92. This essentially separates the previous S. Warren et al. "stratus," "cumulus," and "cumuionimbus" climatologies into their constituent cloud types. The different geographical and seasonal distributions of low cloud types indicate that each type within the Warren et al. categories is associated with different meteorological conditions. Hence, investigations based on individual low cloud types instead of broader categories will best identify the processes and variability in meteorological parameters responsible for observed variability in cloudiness. The present study is intended to provide a foundation for future investigations by documenting the climatological distributions of low cloud type frequency and demonstrating the physical consistency with expected patterns of boundary layer structure, advection, surface divergence, and synoptic activity over the global ocean.Further analyses are conducted to examine in greater detail transitions in low cloud type and related boundary layer processes in the eastern subtropical North Pacific, eastern equatorial Pacific, and western North Pacific during summer. Maxima in the climatological frequencies of stratocumulus, cumulus-with-stratocumulus, and cumulus occur progressively equatorward over eastern subtropical oceans, consistent with an increasing decoupled boundary layer. This transition is also observed north of the equatorial cold tongue, but advection over colder SST on the southern side of equatorial cold tongue sometimes produces an absence of low cloudiness. A transition between cumuliform low cloud types to the south and stratiform low cloud types to the north occurs over the region of strong SST gradient in the western North Pacific, and during summer the maximum frequency of stratus associated with precipitation is collocated with the region of strong SST gradient.},

We show that, at the global scale, a decrease in emissions of the considered aerosols ( or their precursors) produces a warmer and moister climate. In addition, the tropospheric burdens of OH and ozone increase when aerosol emissions are decreased. The ozone response is a combination of the impact of reduced heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 and increased ozone loss in a moister atmosphere. Under reduced aerosol emissions, the tropospheric burden of NOx ( NO + NO2) is strongly reduced by an increase in nitric acid formation but also increased by the reduced N2O5 uptake. Finally, we discuss the significant difference found between the combined impact of all aerosols emissions and the sum of their individual contributions.},

	abstract = {The independent pixel approximation (IPA) is one of the simplest methods of computing solar radiative fluxes for inhomogeneous clouds. It claims that if p(tau) is a normalized probability density function for cloud optical depth tau and R(pp)(tau) is plane-parallel, homogeneous (PPH) albedo, mean cloud albedo can be approximated by integrating p(tau)R(pp)(tau) over all tau. The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of the gamma distribution function to represent p(tau) for marine boundary layer clouds and to examine the accuracy of the ensuing gamma IPA albedos.In a separate study, pixel values of tau were inferred from high spatial resolution Landsat imagery of marine boundary layer clouds. The present study utilizes 45 images, each measuring (58 km)(2). For each image, a density function p(obs)(tau) is estimated, and, using the mean {\textless}(tau)over bar{\textgreater} and variance of tau, a corresponding truncated gamma distribution function p(gamma)(tau) is defined. For a diverse range of clouds, p(gamma)(tau) usually approximate p(obs)(tau) well. The best results are for overcast stratocumulus and small, broken cumulus, while the worst results are for streets of moderately thick cumulus observed at relatively large solar zenith angles. After both p(obs)(tau) and corresponding p(gamma)(tau) are filtered through the IPA; however, resulting solar zenith angle dependent and spherical albedos often agree to well within 5\%, regardless of cloud type. Furthermore, disparities between IPA albedos using p(obs)(7) and p(gamma)(tau) are roughly 10 times smaller than disparities between IPA albedos using p(obs)(tau) and corresponding PPH albedos [R(pp)({\textless}(tau)over bar{\textgreater})]. Thus, for marine boundary layer clouds, the gamma IPA can be expected to remove most of the PPH bias currently present in GCMs. A simple parameterization, dependent on cloud fraction, is furnished that may enable the gamma IPA to be used in GCMs.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the nature of regularity in cumulus cloud fields at the spatial scales suggested by Weger et al. [1993]. We analyzed cumulus cloud fields from Landsat, advanced very high resolution radiometer, and GOES satellite imagery for regularity, using nearest-neighbor cumulative distribution statistics. We found that the spatial scales over which regularity is observed vary from 20 km to 150 km in diameter. Clouds involved in regularity range in radius from about 300 m to 1.5 km. For the cases analyzed, we observed regularity in about 20\% of the scenes, while randomness was the dominant spatial distribution for cumulus cloud fields; in addition, we frequently observed a tendency toward regularity. For regions in which we observed either regularity or randomness with a tendency toward regularity, small clouds were inhibited up to a distance of 3 cloud radii from the center of the large cloud. We also determined the size distributions of clouds, using a power law. For clouds larger than 1.5 km radius the exponent of the power law was correlated to the type of spatial distribution of the clouds. The exponent has largest values for regular spatial distributions, smallest values for clustered distributions, and in-between values for random spatial distributions. analysis of GOES scenes shows that the spatial distribution tends to be clustered in the early stages of the cloud field. During the mature phase it becomes either random, regular, or random with tendency toward regularity. During the later stages of cloud field development the spatial distribution once again becomes clustered.},

	abstract = {Thermal channel (channel 6, 10.4-12.5 mum) images of five Landsat thematic mapper cumulus scenes over the ocean are examined. These images are thresholded using the standard International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project thermal threshold algorithm. The individual clouds in the cloud fields are segmented to obtain their structural statistics which include size distribution, orientation angle, horizontal aspect ratio, and perimeter-to-area (PtA) relationship. It is found that the cloud size distributions exhibit a double power law with the smaller clouds having a smaller absolute exponent. The cloud orientation angles, horizontal aspect ratios, PtA exponents are found in good agreement with earlier studies. A technique also is developed to recognize individual cells within a cloud so that statistics of cloud cellular structure can be obtained. Cell structural statistics are computed for each cloud. Further examination reveals that unicellular clouds are generally smaller (less-than-or-equal-to 1 km) and have smaller PtA exponents, while multicellular clouds are larger (greater-than-or-equal-to 1 km) and have larger PtA exponents. Cell structural statistics are similar to those of the smaller clouds. Each cell is approximated as a quadric surface using a linear least squares fit. Most cells are found to have the shape of a hyperboloid of one sheet. However, about 15\% of the cells are best modeled by a hyperboloid of two sheets. Contrary to intuition, less than 1\% of the clouds are found to be ellipsoidal. The number of cells in a cloud is found to increase slightly faster than linearly with increasing cloud size. The mean nearest neighbor distance between cells in a cloud, however, appears to increase linearly with increasing cloud size and to reach a maximum when the cloud effective diameter is about 10 km; then it decreases with increasing cloud size. Sensitivity studies of threshold and lapse rate show that neither has a significant impact upon the results. A goodness-of-fit ratio is used to provide a quantitative measure of the individual cloud results. Significantly improved results are obtained after applying a smoothing operator, suggesting that eliminating subresolution scale variations with higher spatial resolution may yield even better shape analyses.},

	abstract = {Cloud fields adopt many different patterns that can have a profound effect on the amount of sunlight reflected back to space, with important implications for the Earth's climate. These cloud patterns can be observed in satellite images of the Earth and often exhibit distinct cell-like structures associated with organized convection at scales of tens of kilometres(1-3). Recent evidence has shown that atmospheric aerosol particles-through their influence on precipitation formation-help to determine whether cloud fields take on closed (more reflective) or open (less reflective) cellular patterns(4,5). The physical mechanisms controlling the formation and evolution of these cells, however, are still poorly understood(6), limiting our ability to simulate realistically the effects of clouds on global reflectance. Here we use satellite imagery and numerical models to show how precipitating clouds produce an open cellular cloud pattern that oscillates between different, weakly stable states. The oscillations are a result of precipitation causing downward motion and outflow from clouds that were previously positively buoyant. The evaporating precipitation drives air down to the Earth's surface, where it diverges and collides with the outflows of neighbouring precipitating cells. These colliding outflows form surface convergence zones and new cloud formation. In turn, the newly formed clouds produce precipitation and new colliding outflow patterns that are displaced from the previous ones. As successive cycles of this kind unfold, convergence zones alternate with divergence zones and new cloud patterns emerge to replace old ones. The result is an oscillating, self-organized system with a characteristic cell size and precipitation frequency.},

Cloud clusters span a somewhat lognormal distribution of sizes. The cloudiness per unit size interval peaks at small size, but half of the very cold ({\textless}208 K) cloudiness is contributed by cloud clusters greater than 20 000 km2 in size, while half of the moderately cold ({\textless}235 K) cloudiness is contributed by cloud clusters greater than 100 000 km2 in size.The diurnal cycle of cold cloudiness is primarily a sun-synchronous process within large and giant clusters, not a modulation of populations of isolated convective clouds. Deep convection in these clusters peaks before dawn and decreases through the morning; then the moderately cold cloud area expands suddenly in the afternoon. Over the maritime continent, an additional diurnal cycle of small clusters is present, with an afternoon pulse of convection over land and a lesser peak in small-cluster convection over the surrounding seas at night.The eastward-propagating intraseasonal variation (ISV) is apparent in fractional cold cloudiness integrated across the entire tropical latitude belt. The ISV modulates cloud clusters of all sizes, but larger clusters are proportionately more affected than smaller clusters.Cloud clusters have been tracked in time to reveal ”time clusters,” which spatially overlap from one frame of imagery to the next. In some cases, convection is so gregarious and interconnected that these time clusters last for more than two days. These cases are called ”superclusters.” Although they may exist at any given instant as several distinct cloud clusters, these superclusters are apparently real physical entities, as defined by space-time continuity of very cold-topped cloud (proxy for precipitation) area.},

	abstract = {We investigate a class of bounded random-cascade models which ark multiplicative by construction yet additive with respect to some but not all of their properties. We assume the multiplicative weights go to unity as the cascade proceeds; then the resulting field has upper and lower bounds. Two largely complementary multifractal statistical methods of analysis are used, singular measures and structure functions yielding, respectively, the exponent hierarchies D-q and H-q. We study in more detail a specific. subclass of one-dimensional models with weights 1+1(1-2p)r(n-1)(H) at relative scale r(n) = 2(-n) after n cascade steps. The parameter H {\textgreater} O regulates the degree of nonstationarity; at H=O, stationarity prevails and singular ”p-model” cascades [Meneveau and Sreenivasan, Phys. Rev, Lett. 59, 1424 (1987)] are retrieved. Our model has at once large-scale stationarity and small scale nonstationarity with stationary increments. Due to the boundedness, the D-q all converge to unity with increasing n; the rate of convergence is estimated and the results are discussed in terms of ”residual” multifractality (a spurious singularity spectrum due to finite-size effects). The structure-function exponents are more interesting: H-q = min H,1/q in the limit n –{\textgreater} infinity. We further focus on the cases q = 1, related to the fractal structure of the graph, q = 2, related to the energy spectrum, and q = 1/H, the critical order beyond which our multiplicative (and multiscaling) bounded cascade model can be statistically distinguished from fractional Brownian motion, the corresponding additive (and monoscaling) model. This bifurcation in statistical behavior can be interpreted as a first-order phase transition traceable to the boundedness, itself inherited from the large-scale stationarity.

We use the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS) Aerosol Index ( AI) data product as a surrogate to estimate interannual variability in biomass burning for six regions: Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia, Brazil, Central America and Mexico, Canada and Alaska, and Asiatic Russia. The AI data set is available from 1979 to the present with an interruption in satellite observations from mid-1993 to mid-1996; this data gap is filled where possible with estimates of area burned from the literature for different regions. Between August 1996 and July 2000, the ATSR fire-counts are used to provide specific locations of emissions and a record of interannual variability throughout the world. We use our methodology to estimate mean seasonal and interannual variations for emissions of carbon monoxide from biomass burning, and we find that no trend is apparent in these emissions over the last two decades, but that there is significant interannual variability.},

Statistics are calculated in five sublayers, from cloud base to cloud top, and they are utilized for deriving estimates of cloud optical thickness and liquid water path, by assuming either random or maximum overlap. The resulting in situ frequency distributions of optical thickness and liquid water path are validated against distributions of these two parameters retrieved from independent remote sensing measurements of cloud radiances. They are also used for testing parameterizations of optical thickness based on liquid water path and either the droplet effective radius or the cloud droplet number concentration. This unique data set of extensive, concomitant, and independent measurements of cloud microphysical and radiative properties is finally used for assessing the detectability of the aerosol indirect effect through examination of the correlation between cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius. If only cases of comparable values of geometrical thickness are considered, the correlation between optical thickness and effective radius is negative, as anticipated by Twomey [1977]. However, if the most polluted cases are also accounted for, the trend suggests a positive correlation. In fact, the most polluted cloud systems sampled during ACE-2 were slightly drier, hence thinner, than the marine and intermediate cases, hence producing a positive correlation between optical thickness and droplet effective radius. This study demonstrates that the monitoring of the aerosol indirect effect with satellite observations requires an independent retrieval of the liquid water path together with the cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius.},

	abstract = {[1] Numerical simulations of a cloudy marine boundary layer (MBL) observed during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment were performed to study the influence of entrainment of free tropospheric cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) on cloud microphysics, dynamics, and radiative properties. The initial CCN concentration is 100 cm(-3) in one simulation, while in the second simulation it varies from 100 cm(-3) below the cloud top to a peak of 1200 cm(-3) at the inversion. In the clean case, cooling from evaporating drizzle destabilizes the layer just below cloud base (not the entire subcloud layer) with respect to the surface, and promotes stronger penetrating cumulus. In the case with the elevated pollution layer, reduced drizzle at the cloud base results in weaker penetrating cumulus and a less effective supply of surface moisture to the cloud. This results in a much lower liquid water path (LWP) relative to the clean case that offsets the cloud albedo enhancement due to higher drop concentrations. Thus, although entrained CCN enhance the droplet concentration, the net effect on the cloud albedo is small. Additional simulations were performed to study the sensitivity of the MBL to varying levels of large-scale subsidence. The change in large-scale subsidence has a large effect on boundary layer dynamics, cloud microphysics, and the radiative budget. The simulations are used to separate the effects of enhanced albedo due to enhanced drop concentrations at constant LWP and those where LWP is modified due to dynamical feedbacks. For this case study, weaker subsidence results in a cloud with higher LWP and a cloud albedo that is enhanced over and above that due to enhanced droplet concentration. The simulations point to the complex dynamical-microphysical-radiative feedbacks in the MBL and how elevated polluted layers can change cloud radiative forcing in ways that would not be easily predicted by large-scale models.},

In this paper the authors use remote sensing data mainly from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product to investigate a few general cloud macro- and microphysical properties of DCCs. This investigation concentrates on the tallest convective clouds and associated thick anvils that are labeled "deep convective clouds.” General geographical patterns of DCCs from MODIS data are consistent with previous studies. By examining statistics of optical properties of DCCs over different locations of the globe, it is found that cloud optical depth distribution for DCCs shows little interannual variability for individual regions. These distributions, however, change with geographical regions. DCC ice particle size varies with surface elevation and cloud brightness temperature. DCCs that develop over elevated areas tend to have smaller ice particles at cloud top. There is a positive correlation between ice particle size and brightness temperature. The slope of this correlation has significant regional variations, which can be explained either with a simple thermodynamic consideration or with homogeneous freezing of aerosols. The findings have important implications in studying radiation budget, ice cloud microphysics parameterization, and troposphere-stratosphere water vapor exchange.},

	abstract = {By identifying individual tropical cloud clusters in eight months of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project data, the size distribution, average cloud properties, and their variation with system size in tropical convective systems (CS) is examined. The geographic distribution of CS shows a concentration over land areas in the summer hemisphere with little seasonal variation except for the major shift of location into the summer hemisphere. When the tropics are considered as a whole or a region is considered over a whole season, CS of all sizes (from individual convective towers at 2-20 km to the largest mesoscale systems at 200-2000 km) form a continuous size distribution where the area covered by the clouds in each size range is approximately the same. Land CS show a small excess of the smallest CS and a small deficit of the largest CS in comparison to ocean CS. Average CS cloud properties suggest two major cloud types: one with lower cloud-top pressures and much higher optical thicknesses, associated with deep convection, and one with higher cloud-top pressures and lower optical thicknessses, associated with the mesoscale stratiform anvil clouds. The anvil cloud properties show some evidence of a further division into optically thicker and thinner parts. The average properties of these clouds vary in a correlated fashion such that a larger horizontal extent of the convective system cloud is accompanied by a lower convective cloud-top pressure, larger anvil cloud size. and larger anvil cloud optical thickness. These structural properties and their diurnal variation also suggest that the smallest CS may represent a mixture of the formative and dissipating stages of CS, while the medium and large sizes are, principally, the mature stage. A radiative transfer model is used to evaluate the local radiative effects of CS with average cloud properties. The results imply that the mesoscale anvil cloud reinforces the diabatic heating of the atmosphere by the convection and may help sustain these systems at night. The radiative effects of the convective clouds, while unimportant to the total effect of the CS at the top of the atmosphere, may reinforce the diurnal variation of convection. Evaluating the radiative feedback of tropical cloudiness on climate is shown to be very difficult because of the significant diurnal and geographic variations of convective system cloud properties.},

The default CCM3 convection scheme of Zhang and McFarlane produces intraseasonal variability in both zonal winds and precipitation that is much lower than is observed. The convection scheme of Hack produces high tropical intraseasonal zonal wind variability but no coherent convective variability at intraseasonal timescales and low wavenumbers. The McRAS convection scheme produces realistic variability in tropical intraseasonal zonal winds and improved intraseasonal variability in tropical precipitation, although the variability in precipitation is somewhat less than is observed. Intraseasonal variability in CCM3 with the McRAS scheme is highly sensitive to the parameterization of convective precipitation evaporation in unsaturated environmental air and unsaturated downdrafts. Removing these effects greatly reduces intraseasonal variability in the model. Convective evaporation processes in McRAS affect intraseasonal variability mainly through their time-mean effects and not through their variations. Convective rain evaporation and unsaturated downdrafts improve the modeled specific humidity and temperature climates of the Tropics and increase convection on the equator. Intraseasonal variability in CCM3 with McRAS is not improved by increasing the boundary layer relative humidity threshold for initiation of convection, contrary to the results of Wang and Schlesinger. In fact, intraseasonal variability is reduced for higher thresholds. The largest intraseasonal moisture variations during a model Madden-Julian oscillation life cycle occur above the boundary layer, and humidity variations within the boundary layer are small.},

	abstract = {Several studies have uncovered a break in the scaling properties of Landsat cloud scenes at nonabsorbing wavelengths. For scales greater than 200-400 m, the wavenumber spectrum is approximately power law in k(-5/3), but from there down to the smallest observable scales (50-100 m) follows another k(-beta) law with beta {\textgreater}3. This implies very smooth radiance fields. The authors reexamine the empirical evidence for this scale break and explain it using fractal cloud models, Monte Carlo simulations, and a Green function approach to multiple scattering theory. In particular, the authors define the ”radiative smoothing scale” and relate it to the characteristic scale of horizontal photon transport. The scale break was originally thought to occur at a scale commensurate with either the geometrical thickness Delta(z) of the cloud, or with the ”transport” mean free path l(t)=[(1-g)sigma](-1), which incorporates the effect of forward scattering (sigma is extinction and g the asymmetry factor of the phase Function). The smoothing scale is found to be approximately root l(t) Delta(z) at cloud top; this is the prediction of diffusion theory which applies when (1-g)tau=Delta(z)/l greater than or similar to 1 (tau is optical thickness). Since the scale break is a tangizble effect of net horizontal radiative fluxes excited by the fluctuations of tau, the smoothing scale sets an absolute lower bound on the range where one can neglect these fluxes and use plane-parallel theory locally, even for stratiform clouds. In particular, this constrains the retrieval of cloud properties from remotely sensed data. Finally, the characterization of horizontal photon transport suggests a new lidar technique for joint measurements of optical and geometrical thicknesses at about 0.5-km resolution.},

	abstract = {A laboratory study of ice crystal growth characteristics at temperatures between -20degrees and -70degreesC has been performed at ice supersaturations and pressures comparable with those in the atmosphere using a horizontal static diffusion chamber. Maximum dimension, projected area, and volume growth rates, in addition to habit frequency, have been measured for individual habit types as functions of temperature, ice supersaturation, and air pressure. It was found that from -20degrees to -40degreesC and at ice supersaturations in excess of 2\%, the most frequent habits observed were platelike polycrystals and plates, the complexity of forms increasing with increasing supersaturation. Columns appear with low frequency in this temperature range for all supersaturations. At low ice supersaturation (1\%-2\%), the habit consists of thick plates, compact polycrystals, and occasional short columns and is the region with the highest frequency of pristine crystals capable of producing halos.Just colder than -40degreesC, there is a marked shift to columnar behavior except at low to moderate ice supersaturation ({\textless}10\%) where the habit is essentially the same as at warmer temperatures with a small increase in the frequency of short columns. At moderate ice supersaturation (10\%-25\%), long solid columns and polycrystals with columnar and platelike components are observed. Above approximately 25\% ice supersaturation, bullet rosettes, long columns, and column-containing polycrystals are observed, the frequency of bullet rosettes and columns increasing with increasing ice supersaturation. At -60\&DEG;C and colder, needle forms appear along with columnar forms.These characteristics are portrayed in a habit diagram as a function of temperature and ice supersaturation and are essentially in agreement with the vast majority of atmospheric in situ observations at these temperatures, both of which depart from the previous habit diagrams at temperatures colder than -20\&DEG;C compiled by Kobayashi, Magono and Lee, and Hallett and Mason.Habit growth rates and habit frequencies have been measured at 10\&DEG; temperature increments. Exponential fits of these results yield functions that can be used to estimate growth rates and habit distributions at intermediate temperatures for ice supersaturations as low as 1\% up to the maximum values, which might be encountered in the atmosphere due to ventilation effects, approximately up to 50\% above water saturation between -25\&DEG; and -40\&DEG;C and extrapolated water saturation colder than -40\&DEG;C. Within each habit and under identical growth conditions, observed extremes in growth rates for individual crystals in comparison with average values show variances of \&PLUSMN;50\%, reflecting a variance in aspect ratio that suggests a critical role of crystalline defects in growth characteristics. These results indicate an even more complex behavior of ice crystal habit than that observed between 0\&DEG; and -20\&DEG;C, a behavior that depends not only on temperature and ice supersaturation, but also on vapor diffusivity, related to air pressure, and the initial nucleation process.},

One of the difficulties has been the lack of characterization of vertical profiles of cloud hydrometeor phase. Here we propose a technique to estimate the DCC glaciation temperature using passive remote sensing data. It is based on a conceptual model of vertical hydrometeor size profiles inside DCCs. Estimates from the technique agree well with our general understanding of the problem. Furthermore, the link between vertical profiles of cloud particle size and hydrometeor thermodynamic phase is confirmed by a 3-D cloud retrieval technique. The technique is applied to aircraft measurements of cloud side reflectance and the result was compared favorably with an independent retrieval of thermodynamic phase based on different refractive indices at 2.13 mu m and 2.25 mu m.

The power-law exponent of T variance scaling approaches 1.0 outside of the tropics at scales {\textgreater}500-800 km, but it is closer to 0.3 at scales {\textless}500 km, similar to exponents obtained from aircraft campaigns, numerical modeling, and theoretical studies. The T exponents in the tropics at all scales become less than 0.3, with a similar pattern observed within the boundary layer in some extratropical regions. For q, the variance scaling differs substantially from T with exponents near 0.5-0.6 in parts of the tropics and subtropics with little to no scale break, showing some consistency with a very limited set of aircraft and satellite studies. Scaling differences as a function of land and ocean, altitude, and cloudy- and clear-sky scenes are quantified. Both T and q exponents indicate peak magnitudes in the midtroposphere and reductions are observed near the boundary layer and upper troposphere. Seasonal variations of T and q scaling reveal a stronger seasonal cycle over land than ocean, especially for T at large length scales. While the zonal variations of T and q exponents vary significantly for scales {\textless}500 km, the seasonal variations are much smaller in magnitude. The exponents derived from AIRS could eventually be extrapolated to smaller scales in the absence of additional scale breaks {\textless}150 km to provide useful information for constraining subgrid-scale cloud parameterizations.},

The Atlantic paradox refers to a greater tropospheric ozone column amount over the South Atlantic than the North Atlantic during the West African biomass burning season. SHADOZ and MOZAIC data from 1998 - 2002 and 1997 - 2004, respectively, are used to show that these two phenomena are linked. The combined data are used to address the following: Does the ( continental) MOZAIC data modify the appearance of the paradox? Do lower tropospheric MOZAIC data lead to new conclusions about ozone in the wave-one maximum region? During December, January, and February (DJF), the lower troposphere over Africa exhibits a higher ozone signal in the burning hemisphere, that is, north of the equator, so the "paradox” does not appear over the African continent. The MOZAIC data set over Africa highlights another component of the wave-one feature when the tropospheric ozone mixing ratio is viewed in zonal cross section. The lower troposphere makes a nonnegligible contribution to the regionally higher ozone column during the biomass burning periods of each hemisphere ( DJF) for West Africa and June, July, and August (JJA) for the central Africa region. A southern preference for the wave-one character, previously deduced from satellite data, is confirmed with a stronger maximum in September, October, and November ( SON). Both the paradox and wave-one phenomena are consistent with a view that the African continent is a major source of biomass burning and lightning emissions.},

Multiple linear regression is used to relate the radiation budget data to the cloud data. Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical convective regions, and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast. It is suggested that a substantial fraction of the disagreement in longwave cloud forcing in tropical convective regions is associated with the fact that the ERBE scene identification does not take into account variations in upper-tropospheric water vapor. On a global average basis, low clouds make the largest contribution to the net energy balance of the earth, because they cover such a large area and because their albedo effect dominates their effect on emitted thermal radiation. High, optically thick clouds can also very effectively reduce the energy balance, however, because their very high albedos overcome their low emission temperatures.},

A global model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological data is used to interpret the observations. Median concentrations observed over the South Pacific during PEM-Tropics B were 7 pptv NO, 16 pptv peroxyacetyl nitrate ( PAN), and 34 pptv nitric acid (HNO3); the model generally reproduces these observations but overestimates those over the North Pacific. Lightning was the largest source of these species in the equatorial and South Pacific tropospheric column and in the tropical North Pacific upper troposphere. The oceanic source of acetone implied by high observations of acetone concentrations (mean 431 pptv) allows an improved simulation of PAN/NOx chemistry. However, the high acetaldehyde concentrations (mean 78 pptv) measured throughout the troposphere are inconsistent with our understanding of acetaldehyde and PAN chemistry. Simulated concentrations of HNO3 and HNO3/NOx are highly sensitive to the model representation of deep convection and associated HNO3 scavenging. Chemical losses of NOx during PEM-Tropics B exceed chemical sources by a factor of 2 in the South Pacific upper troposphere. The chemical imbalance, also apparent in the low observed HNO3/NOx ratio, is explained by NOx injection from lightning and by frequent convective overturning which depletes HNO3. The observed imbalance was less during the PEM-Tropics A campaign in September 1996, when aged biomass burning effluents over the South Pacific pushed the NOx budget toward chemical steady state.},

	abstract = {This study explores the upper tropospheric anticyclone above eastern North America and its influence on the summertime buildup and decay of lightning NOx (LNOx) and thunderstorm outflow. LNOx transport is simulated with a particle dispersion model that releases a LNOx tracer from the locations of millions of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes during May-September 2004 and 2006. On average, upper tropospheric zonal flow in May transitions to a closed anticyclone above northern Mexico and the southern United States in July that strengthens in August and rapidly decays in September. Concentrations of the LNOx tracer reach a maximum above the southern United States and Gulf of Mexico in July and August. Fourteen study sites across North America exhibit high day-to-day variability of the LNOx tracer in the upper troposphere during summer, with the sites most heavily influenced by the North American summer monsoon having the greatest background concentrations. During late spring and September the western sites have low concentrations with little variability. In general, the west coast sites plus Barbados have the most aged thunderstorm outflow, while the east coast sites have the least aged outflow. More than 80\% of summertime upper tropospheric NOx above the eastern United States is produced by lightning. To produce the best available observation-based view of upper troposphere NOx above North America, measurements from six aircraft campaigns are combined in a single composite plot. The modeled upper tropospheric NOx matches the general continental-scale distribution of NOx in the composite plot, supporting the dominant role of LNOx in the simulations.},

The TES data show significant O-3-CO correlations downwind of polluted continents, with dO(3)/dCO enhancement ratios in the range 0.4 - 1.0 mol mol(-1) and consistent with ICARTT data. The GEOS-Chem model reproduces the O-3-CO enhancement ratios observed in continental outflow, but model correlations are stronger and more extensive. We show that the discrepancy can be explained by spectral measurement errors in the TES data. These errors will decrease in future data releases, which should enable TES to provide better information on O-3-CO correlations.},

The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state - supercooling - has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

The retrieved profiles have sufficient accuracy in the troposphere to see ozone perturbations caused by convection, biomass burning and anthropogenic pollution, and to track their spatiotemporal transport. However, to achieve such accuracy it has been necessary to calibrate OMI radiances carefully (using two days of Aura/Microwave Limb Sounder data taken in the tropics). The retrieved profiles contain similar to 6-7 degrees of freedom for signal, with 5-7 in the stratosphere and 0-1.5 in the troposphere. Vertical resolution varies from 7-11 km in the stratosphere to 10-14 km in the troposphere. Retrieval precisions range from 1\% in the middle stratosphere to 10\% in the lower stratosphere and troposphere. Solution errors (i.e., root sum square of precisions and smoothing errors) vary from 1-6\% in the middle stratosphere to 6-35\% in the troposphere, and are dominated by smoothing errors.

	abstract = {We use a global chemical transport model (GEOSChem) to evaluate the consistency of satellite measurements of lightning flashes and ozone precursors with in situ measurements of tropical tropospheric ozone. The measurements are tropospheric O-3, NO2, and HCHO columns from the GOME satellite instrument, lightning flashes from the OTD and LIS satellite instruments, profiles of O-3, CO, and relative humidity from the MOZAIC aircraft program, and profiles of O-3 from the SHADOZ ozonesonde network. We interpret these multiple data sources with our model to better understand what controls tropical tropospheric ozone. Tropical tropospheric ozone is mainly affected by lightning NOx and convection in the upper troposphere and by surface emissions in the lower troposphere. Scaling the spatial distribution of lightning in the model to the observed flashes improves the simulation of O-3 in the upper troposphere by 5 - 20 ppbv versus in situ observations and by 1 - 4 Dobson Units versus GOME retrievals of tropospheric O-3 columns. A lightning source strength of 6 +/- 2 Tg N/yr best represents in situ observations from aircraft and ozonesonde. Tropospheric NO2 and HCHO columns from GOME are applied to provide top-down constraints on emission inventories of NOx ( biomass burning and soils) and VOCs ( biomass burning). The top-down biomass burning inventory is larger than the bottom-up inventory by a factor of 2 for HCHO and alkenes, and by a factor of 2.6 for NOx over northern equatorial Africa. These emissions increase lower tropospheric O-3 by 5 - 20 ppbv, improving the simulation versus aircraft observations, and by 4 Dobson Units versus GOME observations of tropospheric O-3 columns. Emission factors in the a posteriori inventory are more consistent with a recent compilation from in situ measurements. The ozone simulation using two different dynamical schemes (GEOS-3 and GEOS-4) is evaluated versus observations; GEOS-4 better represents O-3 observations by 5 - 15 ppbv, reflecting enhanced convective detrainment in the upper troposphere. Heterogeneous uptake of HNO3 on aerosols reduces simulated O-3 by 5 - 7 ppbv, reducing a model bias versus in situ observations over and downwind of deserts. Exclusion of HO2 uptake on aerosols increases O-3 by 5 ppbv in biomass burning regions, reducing a model bias versus MOZAIC aircraft measurements.},

We combine these TC4 DC-8 data with satellite data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to estimate the lightning-generated NO2 (LNO2), above background levels, in the observed OMI NO2 fields. We employ improved off-line processing techniques to customize the OMI retrieval for LNO2. Information on lightning flashes (primarily cloud-to-ground) observed by the Costa Rica Lightning Detection Network operated by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad and the World Wide Lightning Location Network were examined over storms upwind of regions where OMI indicates enhanced LNO2. These flash data are compared with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission/Lightning Imaging Sensor satellite data to estimate total flashes. Finally, using [NOx]/[NO2] ratios from NASA's Global Modeling Initiative model, we estimate LNOx production per flash for four cases and obtain rates of similar to 100-250 mol/flash. These are consistent with rates derived from previous studies of tropical and subtropical storms and below those from modeling of observed midlatitude storms. In our study, environments with stronger anvil-level winds were associated with higher production rates. LIS flash footprint data for one of the low-LNOx production cases with weak upper tropospheric winds suggest below-average flash lengths for this storm. LNOx enhancements over background determined from the OMI data were in less than, but roughly proportional to, aircraft estimates.},

Here we study the scaling properties of the recently introduced scale-free model, that can account for the observed power-law distribution of the connectivities. We develop a mean-field method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual vertices, and use this to calculate analytically the connectivity distribution and the scaling exponents. The mean-field method can be used to address the properties of two variants of the scale-free model, that do not display power-law scaling. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Global 3-D tropospheric chemistry models in the literature show large differences in global budget terms for tropospheric ozone. The ozone production rate in the troposphere, P(O-x), varies from 2300 to 5300 Tg yr(-1) across models describing the present-day atmosphere. The ensemble mean of P(O-x) in models from the post-2000 literature is 35\% higher than that compiled in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR). Simulations conducted with the GEOS-Chem model using two different assimilated meteorological data sets for 2001 (GEOS-3 and GEOS-4), as well as 3 years of GISS GCM meteorology, show P(O-x) values in the range 4250-4700 Tg yr(-1); the differences appear mostly because of clouds. Examination of the evolution of P(O-x) over the GEOS-Chem model history shows major effects from changes in heterogeneous chemistry, the lightning NOx source, and the yield of organic nitrates from isoprene oxidation. Multivariate statistical analysis of model budgets in the literature indicates that 74\% of the variance in P(O-x) across models can be explained by differences in NOx emissions, inclusion of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs, mostly biogenic isoprene), and ozone influx from stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). Higher NOx emissions, more widespread inclusion of NMVOC chemistry, and weaker STE in the more recent models increase ozone production; however, the effect of NMVOCs does not appear generally sensitive to the magnitude of emissions within the range typically used in models (500-900 Tg C yr(-1)). We find in GEOS-Chem that P(O-x) saturates when NMVOC emissions exceed 200 Tg C yr(-1) because of formation of organic nitrates from isoprene oxidation, providing an important sink for NOx.},

Lookup tables of top-of-atmosphere 0.65-μm reflectance are developed for ice-over-water cloud systems using radiative transfer calculations for various combinations of ice-over-water cloud layers. The liquid and ice water paths, LWP and IWP, respectively, are determined with the MCRS using these lookup tables with a combination of microwave (MW), visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) data. LWP, determined directly from the TMI MW data, is used to define the lower-level cloud properties to select the proper lookup table. The properties of the upper-level ice clouds, such as optical depth and effective size, are then derived using the Visible-Infrared Solar-infrared Split-Window technique (VISST), which matches the VIRS IR, 3.9 μm, and VIS data to the multilayer cloud lookup table reflectances and a set of emittance parameterizations. Initial comparisons with surface-based radar retrievals suggest that this enhanced MCRS can significantly improve the accuracy and decrease the IWP in overlapped clouds by 42 and 13\% compared to using the single-layer VISST and an earlier simplified MW-VIS-IR (MVI) differencing method, respectively, for ice-over-water cloud systems. The tropical distribution of ice-over-water clouds is the same as derived earlier from combined TMI and VIRS data, but the new values of IWP and optical depth are slightly larger than the older MVI values and exceed those of single-layered clouds by 7 and 11\%, respectively. The mean IWP from the MCRS is 8-14\% greater than that retrieved from radar retrievals of overlapped clouds over two surface sites, and the standard deviations of the differences are similar to those for single-layered clouds. Examples of a method for applying the MCRS over land without MW data yield similar differences with the surface retrievals. By combining the MCRS with other techniques that focus primarily on optically thin cirrus over low water clouds, it will be possible to more fully assess the IWP in all conditions over ocean except for precipitating systems.},

	abstract = {We present a retrieval of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite instrument that improves in several ways over previous retrievals, especially in the accounting of Rayleigh and cloud scattering. Slant columns, which are directly fitted without low-pass filtering or spectral smoothing, are corrected for an artificial offset likely induced by spectral structure on the diffuser plate of the GOME instrument. The stratospheric column is determined from NO2 columns over the remote Pacific Ocean to minimize contamination from tropospheric NO2. The air mass factor (AMF) used to convert slant columns to vertical columns is calculated from the integral of the relative vertical NO2 distribution from a global 3-D model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological data (Global Earth Observing System (GEOS)-CHEM), weighted by altitude-dependent scattering weights computed with a radiative transfer model (Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer), using local surface albedos determined from GOME observations at NO2 wavelengths. The AMF calculation accounts for cloud scattering using cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, and cloud optical thickness from a cloud retrieval algorithm (GOME Cloud Retrieval Algorithm). Over continental regions with high surface emissions, clouds decrease the AMF by 20-30\% relative to clear sky. GOME is almost twice as sensitive to tropospheric NO2 columns over ocean than over land. Comparison of the retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns for July 1996 with GEOS-CHEM values tests both the retrieval and the nitrogen oxide radical (NOx) emissions inventories used in GEOS-CHEM. Retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns over the United States, where NOx emissions are particularly well known, are within 18\% of GEOS-CHEM columns and are strongly spatially correlated (r = 0.78, n = 288, p {\textless} 0.005). Retrieved columns show more NO2 than GEOS-CHEM columns over the Transvaal region of South Africa and industrial regions of the northeast United States and Europe. They are lower over Houston, India, eastern Asia, and the biomass burning region of central Africa, possibly because of biases from absorbing aerosols.},

The cold-cloud depth is defined as the height from the melting level, which is the altitude at 0 degree, to the storm height. It is found that the NFSC is approximately proportional to the fifth power of the cold-cloud depth. In addition, it should be noticed that the relationship does not have regional dependencies. Two simple dimensional analyses indicate that the fifth power of the cold-cloud depth is proportional to the stored static electric energy and to the charging rate in the convective cloud.},

First, we numerically compute the spectral signals of CO2 forcing and feedbacks of temperature, water vapor, and cloud. Then, we investigate whether we can separate these signals from the total change in the OLR spectrum through an optimal detection method. Uncertainty in optimal detection arises from the uncertainty in the shape of the spectral fingerprints, the natural variability of the OLR spectrum, and a nonlinearity effect due to the cross-correlation of different climate responses. We find that the uncertainties in optimally detected greenhouse-gas forcing, water vapor, and temperature feedbacks are substantially less than their overall magnitudes in a double-CO2 experiment, and thus the detection results are robust. The accuracy in surface temperature and cloud feedbacks, however, is limited by the ambiguity in their fingerprints. Combining ambiguous feedback signals reduces the uncertainty in the combined signal. Auxiliary data are required to fully resolve the difficulty.},

The analysis is based on high-resolution global imagery of cloud brightness temperatures from satellites and from contemporaneous reanalysis temperatures. The coverage by deep convection decreases nearly exponentially with increasing altitude in the tropopause region. Convection is found at temperatures colder than the tropical cold point tropopause over similar to0.5\% (+/-0.25\%) of the tropics. Convection rarely penetrates more than 1.5 km above the tropopause. Large-scale relationships between cold tropopause temperatures and deep convection indicate that where the tropopause is coldest convection penetrates most frequently. Small-scale relationships show that the coldest diurnal tropopause temperatures occur after the diurnal peak in deep convection at tropopause levels over land. The coverage by deep convection is used to estimate the mass exchange or turnover time due to convection in the tropopause region. This turnover time is of the order of weeks at 12 km but increases to longer than a year at 18 km, with significant uncertainties in the tropopause region.},

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program \#5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound, for each region and sector, is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate and black carbon deposition over Greenland is in very good agreement with the ice-core observations spanning the simulation period. Finally, aerosol optical depth and additional aerosol diagnostics are shown to be in good agreement with previously published estimates and observations.},

	abstract = {[1] This paper studies the significance of large-scale transport and pyrogenic (i.e., biomass burning) emissions in the production of tropospheric ozone in the tropics. Using aerosol index (AI) and tropospheric column ozone (TCO) time series from 1979 to 2000 derived from the Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer measurements, our study shows significant differences in the seasonal and spatial characteristics of pyrogenic emissions north and south of the equator in the African region and Brazil in South America. Notwithstanding these differences, most of the observed seasonal characteristics are well simulated by the GEOS-CHEM global model of tropospheric chemistry. The only exception is the northern African region where modeled and observed TCO differ significantly. In the Indonesian region the most significant increase in TCO occurred during September-December 1997, following large-scale forest and savanna fires associated with the El Nino induced dry condition. The increase in TCO extended over most of the western Pacific well outside the burning region and was accompanied by a decrease in the eastern Pacific resembling a west-to-east dipole about the dateline. These features are well simulated in the GEOS-CHEM model which suggests that both the biomass burning and changes in meteorological conditions during the El Nino period contributed almost equally to the observed increase in TCO in the Indonesian region. During 1997 the net increase in TCO integrated over the tropical region between 15degreesN and 15degreesS was about 6-8 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) over the mean climatological value of about 77 Tg. The GEOS-CHEM model suggests that most of this increase may have been caused by biomass burning in the Indonesian region since dynamical components of El Nino induced changes in TCO tend to cancel out in the area-averaged data. In addition to biomass burning, the interannual variability in the area-averaged column ozone in the tropics is influenced by a number of factors including the quasi-biennial oscillation and solar cycle.},

At criticality, order-parameter fluctuations diverge and their spatial correlation decays as a power law(1). In systems where the tuning parameter and order parameter are coupled, the critical point can become an attractor, and self-organized criticality ( SOC) results(2,3). Here we argue, using satellite data, that a critical value of water vapour ( the tuning parameter) marks a non-equilibrium continuous phase transition to a regime of strong atmospheric convection and precipitation ( the order parameter) - with correlated regions on scales of tens to hundreds of kilometres. Despite the complexity of atmospheric dynamics, we find that important observables conform to the simple functional forms predicted by the theory of critical phenomena. In meteorology the term 'quasi-equilibrium' refers to a balance between slow large-scale driving processes and rapid release of buoyancy by moist convection(4). Our study indicates that the attractive quasi-equilibrium state, postulated long before SOC ( ref. 5), is the critical point of a continuous phase transition and is thus an instance of SOC.},

Satellite microwave estimates of column water vapor and precipitation show that the onset of convection and precipitation in the tropics can be described as a phase transition, where the rain rate and likelihood of rainfall suddenly increase as a function of water vapor. This is confirmed in Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission radar data used here. Percolation theory suggests that cluster properties should be highly sensitive to changes in the density of occupied pixels, which here translates into a rainfall probability, which in turn sensitively depends on the water vapor. To confirm this, clusters are categorized by their prevalent water vapor. As expected, mean cluster size and radius of gyration strongly increase as the critical water vapor is approached from below. In the critical region one finds scale-free size distributions spanning several orders of magnitude. Large clusters are typically from the critical region: at low water vapor most clusters are small, and supercritical water vapor values are too rare to contribute much. The perimeter of the clusters confirms previous observations in satellite, field, and model data of robust nontrivial scaling. The well-known area-perimeter scaling is fully compatible with the quantitative prediction from the plausible null model of gradient percolation, where the accessible hull is a fractal object with dimension 4/3.},

	abstract = {The influence of climate variability and global warming on the occurrence of tropical cyclones is a controversial issue(1-10). Existing historical databases on the subject are not fully reliable(9,11-13), but a more fundamental hindrance is the lack of basic understanding regarding the intrinsic nature of tropical-cyclone genesis and evolution(14). It is known that tropical cyclones involve more than a passive response to changing external forcing(15), but it is not clear which dynamic behaviour best describes them. Here we present an approach based on the application of the power dissipation index, which constitutes an estimation of released energy(3), to individual tropical cyclones. A robust law emerges for the statistics of power dissipation index, valid in four different ocean basins and over long time periods. In addition to suggesting a description of the physics of tropical cyclones in terms of critical phenomena(16,17), the scaling law enables us to quantify their response to changing climatic conditions, with an increase in the largest power dissipation index values with sea surface temperature or the presence of El Nino phenomena, depending on the basin under consideration. In this way, we demonstrate that the recent upswing in North Atlantic hurricane activity does not involve tropical cyclones that are quantitatively different from those in other sustained high-activity periods before 1970.},

	abstract = {A retrieval of ice crystal size near the tops of active deep cumulonimbus clouds (Cb) throughout the Tropics over a 12-yr period is presented based on radiances from the 3.7-mum channel of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Effective diameters (D-e) are 10\%-20\% smaller over land than ocean. Downwind of continents, crystals are smallest when low-level, offshore transport is strongest. Other regional, seasonal, interannual, and long-term variations are also found. These are compared with variations of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectroradiometer (TOMS) retrieved tropospheric aerosol and with variations of convective intensity and amount in an effort to identify potential causes by statistical association. Ice particles prove to be smaller when aerosol amounts are greater and when convection is more intense, but appear unrelated to convective rate of occurrence. Aerosols appear to be the most important influence on seasonal and longer timescales, with a consistent similar to20\% decrease in Cb crystal effective diameter per unit increase in TOMS aerosol index in regions of biomass burning. In the Sahel region of Africa, where dust and burning both contribute to TOMS retrievals, this sensitivity is closer to similar to10\%. The variety of signals makes the possibility of accidental statistical association unlikely, although it cannot be ruled out. Based on these numbers and on geographic maps of D-e, open biomass burning appears to be more important than urban sources of aerosol in influencing Cb microphysics. Dust generated near burning sites may also contribute to the observed aerosol influence on D-e.},

A three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic cloud model is used to perform numerical simulation of a supercell that occurred in Montana in 1981. The jumping cirrus phenomenon is reproduced in the simulated storm. Analysis of the model results shows that the jumping cirrus phenomenon is produced by the breaking of the gravity waves excited by the strong convection inside the storm. The wave breaking process causes some moisture to detach from the storm cloud and jump into the stratosphere. The apparent upstream motion of the jumping cirrus is true only relative to the storm. The jumping cirrus phenomenon represents an irreversible transport mechanism of materials from the troposphere to the stratosphere.},

	abstract = {Satellite observations of clouds and precipitation have a history stretching back over 40 years. The observations of clouds initially led to the inference of precipitation from cloud top features and subsequently more direct methods derived from passive microwave observations. More recently, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) has provided unprecedented information from the first active microwave instrument specifically designed to measure rainfall, the precipitation radar (PR). This paper utilises data from the TRMM PR for the period December 1997 to November 2005 to investigate rainfall over Hawaii and the surrounding ocean. The PR instrument not only provides spatial information on rainfall, but also vertical profiles of precipitation. Data from the PR instrument is used to map rainfall at a spatial resolution of 5 km and, utilising the information from the vertical profiles, map the distribution of trade-wind and non-trade-wind precipitation. This paper provides quantitative estimates of rainfall over Hawaii and the surrounding ocean that generally match those of surface observations and models. It is found that the islands exert a significant influence on the distribution of the amount and occurrence of precipitation over this region. Copyright (c) 2006 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Under the influence of the east-northeasterly trade winds, the island of Hawaii generates a wake that extends about 200 km to the west-southwest. During the HaRP project in July and August 1990, five wake surveys were carried out by the NCAR Electra. The patterns of wind and aerosol concentration revealed by these flights suggest that Hawaii's wake consists of two large quasi-steady counterrotating eddies. The southern clockwise-rotating eddy carries a heavy aerosol load due to input from the Kilauea volcano. At the eastern end of the wake, the eddies are potentially warmer and more humid than the surrounding trade wind air. Several other features are discussed: sharp shear lines near the northern and southern tips of the island, dry and warm air bands along the shear lines, a small embedded wake behind the Kohala peninsula, wake centerline clouds, hydraulic jumps to the north and south of the island, a descending inversion connected with accelerating trade winds, and evidence for side-to-side wake movement.},

	abstract = {The bulk radar reflectivity structures, 85- and 37-GHz brightness temperatures, and lightning characteristics of precipitating systems in tropical Africa, South America, the east Pacific, and west Pacific are documented using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite during August, September, and October of 1998. The particular focus is on precipitation features [defined as a contiguous area greater than or equal to75 km(2) with either a near-surface reflectivity greater than or equal to20 dBZ or an 85-GHz polarization-corrected temperature (PCT) less than or equal to 250 K] with appreciable rainfall, which account for the bulk of the total rainfall and lightning flash density in their respective regions. Systems over the tropical continents typically have greater magnitudes of reflectivity extending to higher altitudes than tropical oceanic systems. This is consistent with the observation of stronger ice scattering signatures (lower 85- and 37-GHz PCT) in the systems over land. However, when normalized by reflectivity heights, tropical continental features consistently have higher 85-GHz PCT than tropical oceanic features. It is inferred that greater supercooled water contents aloft in the tropical continental systems contribute to this brightness temperature difference.Lightning (as detected by the Lightning Imaging Sensor) is much more likely in tropical continental features than tropical oceanic features with similar brightness temperatures or similar reflectivity heights. Vertical profiles of radar reflectivity add additional information to the nonunique lightning-brightness temperature relationships showing that features with lightning tend to have greater magnitudes of reflectivity and smaller decreases of reflectivity with height above the freezing level than systems without detected lightning.Regional comparisons of the lightning, radar, and microwave signatures of precipitating features show that, over the oceans, the west Pacific has the highest frequency of intense precipitation features (by minimum PCT or maximum reflectivity height). Over land, the intense precipitation features occur more frequently in Africa. These observations are consistent with the relative differences in lightning flash density between the land and ocean regions. The quantitative database of land and ocean features presented here provides a substantial observational framework against which cloud and radiative transfer model results can be tested.},

This paper describes an OMI SO2 algorithm (the band residual difference) that uses calibrated residuals at SO2 absorption band centers produced by the NASA operational ozone algorithm (OMTO3). By using optimum wavelengths for retrieval of SO2, the retrieval sensitivity is improved over NASA predecessor Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) by factors of 10 to 20, depending on location. The ground footprint of OMI is eight times smaller than TOMS. These factors produce two orders of magnitude improvement in the minimum detectable mass Of SO2. Thus, the diffuse boundaries of volcanic clouds can be imaged better and the clouds can be tracked longer. More significantly, the improved sensitivity now permits daily global measurement of passive volcanic degassing of SO2 and of heavy anthropogenic SO2 pollution to provide new information on the relative importance of these sources for climate studies.},

The CERES cloud and radiative flux data products should prove extremely useful in advancing the understanding of cloud-radiation interactions, particularly cloud feedback effects on the earth's radiation balance, For this reason, the CERES data should be fundamental to our ability to understand, detect, and predict global climate change, CERES results should also be very useful for studying regional climate changes associated with deforestation, desertification anthropogenic aerosols, and El Nino/Southern Oscillation events.This overview summarizes the Release 2 version of the planned CERES data products and data analysis algorithms. These algorithms are a prototype for the system that will produce the scientific data required for studying the role of clouds and radiation in the earth's climate system. This release will produce a data processing system designed to analyze the first CERES data, planned for launch on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) in November 1997, followed by the EOS morning (EOS-AM1) platform in 1998.},

The global OH evolution is highly dependent on the CO to NOx emission ratio, and a statistically significant linear relation between this ratio and the OH concentration is found. However, we find large regional variations of OH distributions and methane loss. One third of a calculated increase in global average methane loss (0.50\% per year) can be explained by OH changes resulting from emission changes of CO, NOx and NMVOCs, while two third is due to increases in methane itself.},

	abstract = {A 3-D non-hydrostatic model (EULAG) with warm-rain bulk microphysics was used to study the diurnal cycle of shallow convection and cloudiness in the trade wind boundary layer over the Indian Ocean. Simulations were initialized with soundings obtained during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). In the absence of diurnally varying large-scale forcing, the simulated diurnal cycles of vertical velocities, turbulent fluxes, condensation rate and cloudiness were characterized by distinct daytime reductions. Solar heating in the boundary layer stabilized the air, decreased the relative humidity and, therefore, suppressed cloud-layer turbulence and shallow cumulus convection. As a result, the condensation rate and cloud amount were reduced. Stronger thermal updraughts and turbulent fluxes caused by solar heating in the mixed layer triggered the recovery of cloudiness in the afternoon when the instability in the cloud layer increased.Sensitivity experiments showed that the principal cause of the daytime heating of the atmosphere and reductions in convection and cloudiness was not the diurnally varying surface fluxes nor the cloud radiative effects, but rather the gaseous absorption of solar radiation due mainly to water vapour in the spectral band of 2500-14500 cm(-1) and ozone in the ultraviolet and visible bands. Compared to the average short-wave heating of 0.1 K day(-1) due to cloud droplets, gases enhanced solar heating by about 2.0 K day(-1) in the cloud layer. However, depending on its direction and magnitude, large-scale vertical motion can highly modulate the diurnal cycles driven by solar heating, representing a big uncertainty in observing the diurnal cycle of shallow cumuli.

Simulations are initialized using temperature and moisture profiles measured during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) and sea surface temperatures retrieved from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager. Cloud covers between 4 and 10\% and cloud-averaged liquid water contents of between 0.01 and 0.6 g m(-3) more closely match values retrieved and measured in situ during INDOEX than those modelled in past studies; previous studies found larger cloud coverage associated with cloud spreading below a strong inversion not present in the INDOEX soundings.As in previous studies, a diurnal cycle with reductions Of Cloud cover and liquid water path (LWP) after sunrise is seen, with absorbing aerosols within cloud augmenting the decrease in cloud cover. Variations in aerosol vertical profiles can change semi-direct radiative forcing at the Surface (top of the atmosphere) from + 1.6 (+1.3) W m(-2) when aerosols are confined to Cloud compared to -0.4 (-0.6) W m(-2) when aerosols occur below cloud. Low-level water-vapour mixing ratios decrease as vertical motions increase, the vertical motions being enhanced by below-cloud solar heating and cloud-top radiative cooling and suppressed by in-cloud heating. Cloud cover and LWP are larger for stronger vertical motions, explaining the dependence of radiative forcing on aerosol profile. In the late afternoon and evening, increases in radiative cooling and sensible and latent heat flux, occurring due to reductions in mixed-layer temperature and vapour. allow Cloud cover and LWP to recover to values like those found in simulations without absorbing aerosols.},

	abstract = {Absorbing aerosols (AAs) such as black carbon (BC) or dust absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. Previous studies have described conditions under which AAs either increase or decrease cloud cover. The effect depends on several factors, including the altitude of the AA relative to the cloud and the cloud type. We attempt to categorize the effects into several likely regimes. Cloud cover is decreased if the AAs are embedded in the cloud layer. AAs below cloud may enhance convection and cloud cover. AAs above cloud top stabilize the underlying layer and tend to enhance stratocumulus clouds but may reduce cumulus clouds. AAs can also promote cloud cover in convergent regions as they enhance deep convection and low level convergence as it draws in moisture from ocean to land regions. Most global model studies indicate a regional variation in the cloud response but generally increased cloud cover over oceans and some land regions, with net increased low-level and/or reduced upper level cloud cover. The result is a net negative semi-direct effect feedback from the cloud response to AAs. In some of these climate model studies, the cooling effect of BC due to cloud changes is strong enough to essentially cancel the warming direct effects.},

	abstract = {Many investigations using satellite data have determined that aerosol optical depth and cloud cover are correlated and some have interpreted the correlation as evidence of an aerosol indirect effect on clouds. This study uses in situ aircraft observations taken during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), February-March 1999, and mostly over the northern Indian Ocean, to show that on average, relative humidity increases as distance to the boundaries of small marine trade cumulus decreases. The increase is sufficient to cause substantial growth of hygroscopic aerosol particles and consequently greatly enhance particle scattering cross sections near clouds. The measured increase is from a relative humidity of about 90\% at 1- km horizontal distance from the cloud to about 94-96\% at 100 m from cloud edge. This increase would result in about a 40-80\% increase in aerosol scattering cross section based on the composition used to model the aerosol. Observations of scattering in the vicinity of clouds using 30-m-resolution imagery from the Multichannel Cloud Radiometer (MCR) indicated that the increase in scattering within 1-2 km of cloud edge was about 50\%, comparable to the increase calculated for the particle scattering cross sections. On the basis of these findings, global average estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effect as derived from satellite observations of cloud-free oceans is estimated to be 35-65\% larger than that inferred for large ({\textgreater} 20 km) cloud-free ocean regions. This enhancement is consistent with those derived from satellite observations.},

This paper shows the results of a systematic search through seven full years of the TRMM database to find indicators of uncommonly intense storms. These include strong ({\textgreater} 40 dBZ) radar echoes extending to great heights, high lightning flash rates, and very low brightness temperatures at 37 and 85 GHz. These are used as proxy variables, indicating powerful convective updrafts. The main physical principles supporting this assertion involve the effects of such updrafts in producing and lofting large ice particles high into the storm, where TRMM's radar easily detects them near storm top. TRMM's passive microwave radiometer detects the large integrated ice water path as very low brightness temperatures, while high lightning flash rates are a physically related but instrumentally independent indicator. The geographical locations of these very intense convective storms demonstrate strong regional preferences for certain land areas while they are extremely rare over tropical oceans. Favored locations include the south-central United States, southeast South America, and equatorial Africa. Other regions have extreme storms mainly in specific seasons, such as the Sahel, the Indian subcontinent, and northern Australia. Because intense storms are distributed quite differently from rainfall, these maps provide some new metrics for global models, if they are to simulate the type of convection as a component of our climate system.},

	abstract = {In determining aerosol-cloud interactions, the properties of aerosols must be characterized in the vicinity of clouds. Numerous studies based on satellite observations have reported that aerosol optical depths increase with increasing cloud cover. Part of the increase comes from the humidification and consequent growth of aerosol particles in the moist cloud environment, but part comes from 3-D cloud-radiative transfer effects on the retrieved aerosol properties. Often, discerning whether the observed increases in aerosol optical depths are artifacts or real proves difficult. The paper only addresses the cloud-clear sky radiative transfer interaction part. It provides a simple model that quantifies the enhanced illumination of cloud-free columns in the vicinity of clouds that are used in the aerosol retrievals. This model is based on the assumption that the enhancement in the cloud-free column radiance comes from enhanced Rayleigh scattering that results from the presence of the nearby clouds. This assumption leads to a larger increase of AOT for shorter wavelengths, or to a “bluing” of aerosols near clouds. The assumption that contribution from molecular scattering dominates over aerosol scattering and surface reflection is justified for the case of shorter wavelengths, dark surfaces, and an aerosol layer below the cloud tops. The enhancement in Rayleigh scattering is estimated using a stochastic cloud model to obtain the radiative flux reflected by broken clouds and comparing this flux with that obtained with the molecules in the atmosphere causing extinction, but no scattering.},

	abstract = {[1] There are several dozen papers that study the effects of cloud horizontal inhomogeneity on the retrievals of cloud optical thickness, but only a few of them deal with cloud droplet sizes. This paper is one of the first comprehensive attempts to fill this gap: It takes a close theoretical look at the radiative effects of cloud 3-D structure in retrievals of droplet effective radii. Under some general assumptions, it was found that ignoring subpixel ( unresolved) variability produces a negative bias in the retrieved effective radius, while ignoring cloud inhomogeneity at scales larger than a pixel scale ( resolved variability), on the contrary, leads to overestimation of the domain average droplet size. The theoretical results are illustrated with examples from Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of cumulus (Cu) and stratocumulus (Sc) cloud fields. The analysis of cloud drop size distributions retrieved from both LES fields confirms that ignoring shadowing in 1-D retrievals results in substantial overestimation of effective radii which is more pronounced for broken Cu than for Sc clouds. Collocated measurements of broken Cu clouds by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MODIS) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER) are used to check simulations and theory with observations. The analysis of ASTER and MODIS data and associated derived products recommends against blindly using retrieved effective radii for broken cloud fields, especially if one wants to relate aerosol amounts to cloud droplet sizes.},

	abstract = {Retrievals of cloud properties from satellite imagery often invoke the assumption that the fields of view are overcast when cloud-contaminated, even though a significant fraction are only partially cloud-covered. The overcast assumption leads to biases in the retrieved cloud properties: cloud amounts and droplet effective radii are typically overestimated, while visible optical depths, cloud altitudes, cloud liquid water amounts, and column droplet number concentrations are typically underestimated. In order to estimate these biases, a retrieval scheme was developed to obtain the properties of clouds for partially covered imager fields of view. The partly cloudy pixel retrieval scheme is applicable to single-layered cloud systems and invokes the assumption that clouds that only partially cover a field of view are at the same altitude as nearby clouds from the same layer that completely cover imager pixels. The properties of the retrieval are illustrated through its application to 2-km Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) for a marine stratocumulus scene. The scene was chosen because the cloud properties are typical of such systems based on an analysis of VIRS data for February and March 1998. Comparisons of properties for clouds in partly cloudy pixels and those for clouds in nearby overcast pixels reveal that the optical depths and droplet effective radii are generally smaller for the clouds in the partly cloudy pixels. In addition, for pixel-scale cloud fractions between 0.2 and 0.8, optical depth, droplet effective radius, and column droplet number concentration decrease slowly with decreasing cloud cover fraction. The changes are only about 20\%-30\%, while cloud cover fraction changes by 80\%. For comparison, changes in optical depth and column number concentration retrieved using a threshold method decrease by 80\%-90\%. As long as the cloud cover in partly cloudy pixels is greater than about 0.1, uncertainties in the estimates of the cloud altitudes and of the radiances for the cloud-free portions of the fields of view give rise to uncertainties in the retrieved cloud properties that are comparable to the uncertainties in the properties retrieved for overcast pixels.},

	abstract = {Recent studies utilizing satellite retrievals have shown a strong correlation between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud cover. However, these retrievals from passive sensors are subject to many limitations, including cloud adjacency (or three-dimensional) effects, possible cloud contamination, uncertainty in the AOD retrieval. Some of these limitations do not exist in High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) observations; for instance, HSRL observations are not affected by cloud adjacency effects, are less prone to cloud contamination, and offer accurate aerosol property measurements (backscatter coefficient, extinction coefficient, lidar ratio, backscatter Angstrom exponent, and aerosol optical depth) at a fine spatial resolution ({\textless} 100 m) in the vicinity of clouds. Hence the HSRL provides an important data set for studying aerosol and cloud interaction. In this study, we statistically analyze aircraft-based HSRL profiles according to their distance from the nearest cloud, assuring that all profile comparisons are subject to the same largescale meteorological conditions. Our results indicate that AODs from HSRL are about 8 17\% higher in the proximity of clouds (similar to 100 m) than far away from clouds (4.5 km), which is much smaller than the reported cloud three-dimensional effect on AOD retrievals. The backscatter and extinction coefficients also systematically increase in the vicinity of clouds, which can be explained by aerosol swelling in the high relative humidity (RH) environment and/or aerosol growth through in-cloud processing (albeit not conclusively). On the other hand, we do not observe a systematic trend in lidar ratio; we hypothesize that this is caused by the opposite effects of aerosol swelling and aerosol in-cloud processing on the lidar ratio. Finally, the observed backscatter Angstrom exponent (BAE) does not show a consistent trend because of the complicated relationship between BAE and RH. We demonstrate that BAE should not be used as a surrogate for Angstrom exponent, especially at high RH.},

Understanding this increase is important both for a correct interpretation of observations and for improving our knowledge of aerosol-cloud interactions. However, while the studies suggested several processes to explain the increase, the significance of each process is yet to be determined. This study examines one of the suggested processes-three-dimensional (3-D) radiative interactions between clouds and their surroundings-by analyzing a large dataset of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations over the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. The results indicate that 3-D effects are responsible for a large portion of the observed increase, which extends to about 15 km away from clouds and is stronger (i) at shorter wavelengths (ii) near optically thicker clouds and (iii) near illuminated cloud sides. This implies that it is important to account for 3-D radiative effects in the interpretation of solar reflectance measurements over clear regions in the vicinity of clouds.

This reduction in liquid water content in the area considered cloud-free in the polluted cases is countered by more aerosol uptake of water vapor. Citation: Koren, I., G. Feingold, H. Jiang, and O.

	abstract = {Studying the spatial variability of aerosol properties in the vicinity of clouds is essential to our ability to determine aerosol direct and indirect effects on climate. In this paper, we describe aerosol observations collected near cloud edges by an airborne Sun photometer over dark ocean waters. Focusing on case studies of aerosol measurements near eight cloud edges within a dissipating stratiform cloud deck, we compare the airborne Sun photometer observations to retrievals of aerosol properties using the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol algorithm applied to 500-m-resolution MODIS spectral reflectances. We find a persistent, spectrally neutral increase in the Sun photometer-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) of up to 10\% (0.015) in the 2-km distances closest to the edges of several distinct clouds. At midvisible wavelengths, the MODIS AOD retrievals show similar increases toward cloud edges, although a larger increase in AOD is found in the MODIS along-scan direction. At short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (1240-2130 nm), the MODIS-derived AOD increases near cloud edges are of the order of 0.03 and as such three times as large as the Sun photometer-derived values. Hence, in contrast to recently discussed "bluing” of aerosols near cloud edges, i.e., a preferential apparent increase in the visible reflectances of clearsky pixels due to 3-D radiative transfer effects in the vicinity of clouds, we find a "reddening” of aerosols in the MODIS 500-m-resolution aerosol retrievals near clouds. This "reddening” in our study can be traced to larger absolute increases in SWIR reflectances when compared to visible reflectances near clouds, which in turn seem to stem from larger electronic cross talk in the MODIS SWIR bands (5-7). We note that the lack of "bluing” in our MODIS observations is likely due to the small geometric and optical thicknesses of the clouds considered.},

We test the hypothesis that aerosol indirect effects are present throughout the troposphere. Theoretical cloud reflectance values are calculated by application of the discrete-ordinate DISORT multiple scattering program, as a function of cloud top pressure, aerosol optical depth, and cloud phase ( i.e., liquid droplets and cloud ice), and are compared to MODIS cloud reflectance data at 1.38 and 3.75 mu m. Aerosol indirect effects are apparent for pressure levels associated with liquid droplets; that is, derivatives of cloud reflectance with respect to aerosol optical depth at 3.75 mu m for liquid droplets over land and ocean are larger than corresponding derivatives associated with theoretical aerosol direct effects. Aerosol indirect effects are not apparent for pressure levels associated with tropospheric ice crystals.},

Ice cloud effective radii (r(e)), also from Aqua MODIS, are also analyzed to investigate possible aerosol effects on ice clouds. Our analysis focuses on five regions where ice clouds are collocated with high UT CO loadings: South America (SAM), southern Africa (SAF), northern Africa (NAF), South Asia (SAS), and East Asia (EAS). We find three levels of AOT to CO sensitivity. High AOT sensitivity to CO is characterized by a rapid increase of AOT when CO increases. SAM in August-November and SAF in June September fall into this category. Moderate AOT sensitivity to CO is characterized by moderate increase of AOT with CO. It includes SAF in October-May, NAF in January March, SAS in all months, and EAS in August-September. The other months for each region fall into the low sensitivity category. The variations of sensitivity in different regions and seasons result from different emission sources coupled with dynamic influence. CO can be used as an aerosol proxy for the "high” and "moderate” sensitivity cases. During those times, r(e) for polluted clouds is smaller than that for clean clouds, suggesting an indirect effect of aerosol on ice clouds. CO is not a good aerosol index in the low sensitivity cases, in which polluted clouds defined by CO loadings do not show significant differences from clean clouds in r(e).},

	abstract = {[ 1] The Asian summer monsoon anticyclone is linked to climatological deep convection over Southeast Asia, and the coupling of circulation and convection strongly influences constituent behavior in the upper troposphere - lower stratosphere (UTLS). This work explores the variability of the Asian monsoon circulation and trace constituents linked to transient deep convection, on the basis of dynamical fields and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data, plus water vapor and ozone retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS) instrument. Within the monsoon region, transient deep convection varies with a timescale of similar to 10 - 20 days, linked to active/break cycles in the monsoon circulation. We show that these convective events trigger variations of the anticyclone itself, with strong correlations between OLR and the area of low potential vorticity (PV) defining the anticyclone. Relatively high PV ( stratospheric air) is also advected to low latitudes to the east of the anticyclone following enhanced convection. AIRS data show that the transient convective events are associated with the vertical transport of low ozone and high water vapor into the UTLS region, with significant effects over potential temperature levels 340 - 360 K ( similar to 7 - 13 km). Idealized transport calculations are used to demonstrate that constituent anomalies are confined within the upper tropospheric anticyclone, and this confinement contributes to the climatological constituent patterns observed during summer.},

Here, we identify the transport of air masses from the surface, through the Asian monsoon, and deep into the stratosphere, using satellite observations of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a tropospheric pollutant produced in biomass burning. A key factor in this identification is that HCN has a strong sink from contact with the ocean; much of the air in the tropical upper troposphere is relatively depleted in HCN, and hence, broad tropical upwelling cannot be the main source for the stratosphere. The monsoon circulation provides an effective pathway for pollution from Asia, India, and Indonesia to enter the global stratosphere.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone changes are investigated using a selected network of surface and ozonesonde sites to give a broad geographic picture of long-term variations. The picture of long-term tropospheric ozone changes is a varied one in terms of both the sign and magnitude of trends and in the possible causes for the changes. At mid latitudes of the S.H. three time series of similar to 20 years in length agree in showing increases that are strongest in the austral spring (August-October). Profile measurements show this increase extending through the mid troposphere but not into the highest levels of the troposphere.In the N.H. in the Arctic a period of declining ozone in the troposphere through the 1980s into the mid-1990s has reversed and the overall change is small. The decadal-scale variations in the troposphere in this region are related in part to changes in the lowermost stratosphere.At mid latitudes in the N.H., continental Europe and Japan showed significant increases in the 1970s and 1980s. Over North America rises in the 1970s are less than those seen in Europe and Japan, suggesting significant regional differences. In all three of these mid latitude, continental regions tropospheric ozone amounts appear to have leveled off or in some cases declined in the more recent decades. Over the North Atlantic three widely separated sites show significant increases since the late-1990s that may have peaked in recent years.In the N.H. tropics both the surface record and the ozonesondes in Hawaii show a significant increase in the autumn months in the most recent decade compared to earlier periods that drives the overall increase seen in the 30-year record. This appears to be related to a shift in the transport pattern during this season with more frequent flow from higher latitudes in the latest decade. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We analyze the trends, seasonality, and interannual variability of these quantities at aircraft cruise levels (7.7 - 11.3 km) within the tropics ( 20 degrees S - 20 degrees N). Mean lapse rates for temperature and log( water vapor) are nearly identical in both tropics. The root-mean-square variance in temperature over cruise levels, seasons, and years is small, {\textless}= 1 degrees C. The seasonal range in water vapor, a factor of 2.5, is much larger than expected from the seasonal range in temperature (1.7 degrees C) if the two scale with the lapse rate relation or the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The mean ozone abundance in the region sampled is 45 ppb in the north tropics and 50 ppb in the south tropics. This 112- month period shows a clearly linear increase in ozone over the north tropics with a trend fit of 1.12 +/- 0.05 ppb/yr. In the south tropics, which has a large seasonal range of over 25 ppb, the trend is less obvious but still robust, 1.03 +/- 0.08 ppb/yr. These trends in the upper troposphere are twice as large as reported for surface ozone over the tropical Atlantic (Lelieveld et al., 2004), but this pattern of ozone increases is consistent with projected increases driven by industrial emissions.},

	abstract = {In the lowermost layer of the atmosphere-the troposphere-ozone is an important source of the hydroxyl radical, an oxidant that breaks down most pollutants and some greenhouse gases(1). High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are toxic, however, and have a detrimental effect on human health and ecosystem productivity(1). Moreover, tropospheric ozone itself acts as an effective greenhouse gas(2). Much of the present tropospheric ozone burden is a consequence of anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors(3) resulting in widespread increases in ozone concentrations since the late 1800s(3-7). At present, east Asia has the fastest-growing ozone precursor emissions(8). Much of the springtime east Asian pollution is exported eastwards towards western North America(9). Despite evidence that the exported Asian pollution produces ozone(10), no previous study has found a significant increase in free tropospheric ozone concentrations above the western USA since measurements began in the late 1970s(5,11,12). Here we compile springtime ozone measurements from many different platforms across western North America. We show a strong increase in springtime ozone mixing ratios during 1995-2008 and we have some additional evidence that a similar rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio has occurred since 1984. We find that the rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio is greatest when measurements are more heavily influenced by direct transport from Asia. Our result agrees with previous modelling studies, which indicate that global ozone concentrations should be increasing during the early part of the twenty-first century as a result of increasing precursor emissions, especially at northern mid-latitudes(13), with western North America being particularly sensitive to rising Asian emissions(14). We suggest that the observed increase in springtime background ozone mixing ratio may hinder the USA's compliance with its ozone air quality standard.},

	abstract = {Chemically active climate compounds are either primary compounds like methane (CH4), removed by oxidation in the atmosphere, or secondary compounds like ozone (O-3), sulfate and organic aerosols, both formed and removed in the atmosphere. Man-induced climate-chemistry interaction is a two-way process: Emissions of pollutants change the atmospheric composition contributing to climate change through the aforementioned climate components, and climate change, through changes in temperature, dynamics, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric stability, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions, affects the atmospheric composition and oxidation processes in the troposphere. Here we present progress in our understanding of processes of importance for climate-chemistry interactions, and their contributions to changes in atmospheric composition and climate forcing. A key factor is the oxidation potential involving compounds like O-3 and the hydroxyl radical (OH). Reported studies represent both current and future changes. Reported results include new estimates of radiative forcing based on extensive model studies of chemically active climate compounds like O-3, and of particles inducing both direct and indirect effects. Through EU projects like ACCENT, QUANTIFY, and the AeroCom project, extensive studies on regional and sector-wise differences in the impact on atmospheric distribution are performed. Studies have shown that land-based emissions have a different effect on climate than ship and aircraft emissions, and different measures are needed to reduce the climate impact. Several areas where climate change can affect the tropospheric oxidation process and the chemical composition are identified. This can take place through enhanced stratospheric-tropospheric exchange of ozone, more frequent periods with stable conditions favoring pollution build up over industrial areas, enhanced temperature induced biogenic emissions, methane releases from permafrost thawing, and enhanced concentration through reduced biospheric uptake. During the last 5-10 years, new observational data have been made available and used for model validation and the study of atmospheric processes. Although there are significant uncertainties in the modeling of composition changes, access to new observational data has improved modeling capability. Emission scenarios for the coming decades have a large uncertainty range, in particular with respect to regional trends, leading to a significant uncertainty range in estimated regional composition changes and climate impact.

	abstract = {An effective method is presented for determining the ozone (O-3) mixing ratio in the onshore flow of marine air at the North American west coast. By combining the data available from all marine boundary layer (MBL) sites with simultaneous wind data, decadal temporal trends of MBL O3 in all seasons are established with high precision. The average springtime temporal trend over the past two decades is 0.46 ppbv/yr with a 95\% confidence limit of 0.13 ppbv/yr, and statistically significant trends are found for all seasons except autumn, which does have a significantly smaller trend than other seasons. The average trend in mean annual ozone is 0.34 +/- 0.09 ppbv/yr. These decadal trends at the North American west coast present a striking comparison and contrast with the trends reported for the European west coast at Mace Head, Ireland. The trends in the winter, spring and summer seasons compare well at the two locations, while the Mace Head trend is significantly greater in autumn. Even though the trends are similar, the absolute O-3 mixing ratios differ markedly, with the marine air arriving at Europe in all seasons containing 7 +/- 2 ppbv higher ozone than marine air arriving at North America. Further, the ozone mixing ratios at the North American west coast show no indication of stabilizing as has been reported for Mace Head. In a larger historical context the background boundary layer O-3 mixing ratios over the 130 years covered by available data have increased substantially (by a factor of two to three), and this increase continues at present, at least in the MBL of the Pacific coast region of North America. The reproduction of the increasing trends in MBL O-3 over the past two decades, as well as the difference in the O-3 mixing ratios between the two coastal regions will present a significant challenge for global chemical transport models. Further, the ability of the models to at least semi-quantitatively reproduce the longer-term, historical trends may an even greater challenge.},

The measurements were taken on flights between Europe and the eastern United States and between Europe and the Far East in the latitude range 40-65 degreesN. Our comparison concentrates on the upper troposphere and reveals strong longitudinal variations in seasonal mean NOx of more than 200 pptv, which both models are able to reproduce qualitatively. Vertical profiles show maximum NOx values 2-3 km below the tropopause ("E-shape") with a strong seasonal cycle. E39/C simulates a maximum located at the tropopause and with a reasonable seasonal cycle,The GISS model reproduces the seasonal cycle but not the profile's shape due to its coarser vertical resolution. A comparison of NOx frequency distributions reveals that both models are capable of reproducing the observed variability, except that E39/C shows no very high NOx mixing ratios.Both models show that lightning and surface NOx emissions contribute the most to the seasonal cycle of NOx at tropopause altitudes. The impact of lightning in the upper troposphere does not vary strongly with altitude, whereas the impact of surface emissions decreases with altitude. Among all sources, lightning contributes the most to the variability of NOx in the upper troposphere in northern mid-latitudes during summer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A simulation with the climate-chemistry model (CCM) E39/C is presented, which covers both the troposphere and stratosphere dynamics and chemistry during the period 1960 to 1999. Although the CCM, by its nature, is not exactly representing observed day-by-day meteorology, there is an overall model's tendency to correctly reproduce the variability pattern due to an inclusion of realistic external forcings, like observed sea surface temperatures (e.g. El Nino), major volcanic eruption, solar cycle, concentrations of greenhouse gases, and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. Additionally, climate-chemistry interactions are included, like the impact of ozone, methane, and other species on radiation and dynamics, and the impact of dynamics on emissions (lightning). However, a number of important feedbacks are not yet included (e.g. feedbacks related to biogenic emissions and emissions due to biomass burning). The results show a good representation of the evolution of the stratospheric ozone layer, including the ozone hole, which plays an important role for the simulation of natural variability of tropospheric ozone. Anthropogenic NO, emissions are included with a step-wise linear trend for each sector, but no interannual variability is included. The application of a number of diagnostics (e.g. marked ozone tracers) allows the separation of the impact of various processes/emissions on tropospheric ozone and shows that the simulated Northern Hemisphere tropospheric ozone budget is not only dominated by nitrogen oxide emissions and other ozone pre-cursors, but also by changes of the stratospheric ozone budget and its flux into the troposphere, which tends to reduce the simulated positive trend in tropospheric ozone due to emissions from industry and traffic during the late 80s and early 90s. For tropical regions the variability in ozone is dominated by variability in lightning (related to ENSO) and stratospheretroposphere exchange (related to Northern Hemisphere Stratospheric dynamics and solar activity). Since tropospheric background chemistry is regarded only, the results are quantitatively limited with respect to derived trends. However, the main results are regarded to be robust.Although the horizontal resolution is rather coarse in comparison to regional models, such kind of simulations provide useful and necessary information on the impact of large-scale processes and inter-annuaUdecadal variations on regional air quality.

	abstract = {Observed temperature trends and interannual variations near the tropical tropopause suggest that temperatures up to the cold point are controlled by the troposphere, but some models indicate otherwise. Here, previous investigations of thermal anomalies and heating profiles associated with tropical convective outbreak are extended, by examining behavior near the tropopause. Observations show that active convective systems are locally associated with warm anomalies in the upper troposphere but cold anomalies in the lower troposphere and near the tropopause. Time-dependent solutions of Laplace's equations demonstrate that the cold anomaly below 100 hPa can be, at least partly, accounted for by adiabatic lofting associated with a transient heating pulse at lower levels. However, detailed examination of the cold-point tropopause in the data reveals that it moves against the lofting, downward toward higher pressure and colder potential temperatures, in response to convection. These variations qualitatively agree with longitudinal and ENSO-related variations in tropopause height and temperature reported in the literature, though seen here on hourly timescales. From this, local mesoscale diabatic cooling of several degrees kelvin per day close to the tropopause during active convection is inferred. This exceeds the likely contribution from cloud-top radiative cooling, suggesting a role for convective turbulence in refrigerating the tropopause.},

	abstract = {What are the largest uncertainties in modelling ozone in the troposphere, and how do they affect the calculated ozone budget? Published chemistry-transport model studies of tropospheric ozone differ significantly in their conclusions regarding the importance of the key processes controlling the ozone budget: influx from the stratosphere, chemical processing and surface deposition. This study surveys ozone budgets from previous studies and demonstrates that about two thirds of the increase in ozone production seen between early assessments and more recent model intercomparisons can be accounted for by increased precursor emissions. Model studies using recent estimates of emissions compare better with ozonesonde measurements than studies using older data, and the tropospheric burden of ozone is closer to that derived here from measurement climatologies, 335 +/- 10 Tg. However, differences between individual model studies remain large and cannot be explained by surface precursor emissions alone; cross-tropopause transport, wet and dry deposition, humidity, and lightning also make large contributions. The importance of these processes is examined here using a chemistry-transport model to investigate the sensitivity of the calculated ozone budget to different assumptions about emissions, physical processes, meteorology and model resolution. The budget is particularly sensitive to the magnitude and location of lightning NOx emissions, which remain poorly constrained; the 3 - 8 TgN/yr range in recent model studies may account for a 10\% difference in tropospheric ozone burden and a 1.4 year difference in CH4 lifetime. Differences in humidity and dry deposition account for some of the variability in ozone abundance and loss seen in previous studies, with smaller contributions from wet deposition and stratospheric influx. At coarse model resolutions stratospheric influx is systematically overestimated and dry deposition is underestimated; these differences are 5 - 8\% at the 300 - 600 km grid-scales investigated here, similar in magnitude to the changes induced by interannual variability in meteorology. However, a large proportion of the variability between models remains unexplained, suggesting that differences in chemical mechanisms and dynamical schemes have a large impact on the calculated ozone budget, and these should be the target of future model intercomparisons.},

	abstract = {[1] We present here a first global modeling study on the influence of gas-phase chemistry/ aerosol interactions on estimates of anthropogenic forcing by tropospheric O-3 and aerosols. Concentrations of gas-phase species and sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, primary organic carbon, secondary organic carbon, sea salt, and mineral dust aerosols in the preindustrial, present-day, and year 2100 (IPCC SRES A2) atmospheres are simulated online in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation model II' (GISS GCM II'). With fully coupled chemistry and aerosols, the preindustrial, present-day, and year 2100 global burdens of tropospheric ozone are predicted to be 190, 319, and 519 Tg, respectively. The burdens of sulfate, nitrate, black carbon, and organic carbon are predicted respectively to be 0.32. 0.18, 0.01, 0.33 Tg in preindustrial time, 1.40, 0.48, 0.23, 1.60 Tg in present-day, and 1.37, 1.97, 0.54, 3.31 Tg in year 2100. Anthropogenic O3 is predicted to have a globally and annually averaged present-day forcing of + 0.22 W m(-2) and year 2100 forcing of + 0.57 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Net anthropogenic TOA forcing by internally mixed sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon, and black carbon aerosols is estimated to be virtually zero in the present-day and + 0.34 W m(-2) in year 2100, whereas it is predicted to be - 0.39 W m(-2) in present-day and - 0.61 W m(-2) in year 2100 if the aerosols are externally mixed. Heterogeneous reactions are shown to be important in affecting anthropogenic forcing. When reactions of N2O5, NO3, NO2, and HO2 on aerosols are accounted for, TOA anthropogenic O-3 forcing is less by 20 - 45\% in present-day and by 20 - 32\% in year 2100 at mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, as compared with values predicted in the absence of heterogeneous gas-aerosol reactions. Mineral dust uptake of HNO3 and O-3 is shown to have practically no influence on anthropogenic O3 forcing. Heterogeneous reactions of N2O5, NO3, NO2, and HO2 are predicted to have noticeable impacts on anthropogenic aerosol forcing over industrialized areas, leading to 0 - 2 W m(-2) more anthropogenic aerosol cooling in present-day and 2 - 8 W m(-2) more cooling in year 2100 in these areas as compared with forcings calculated in the absence of heterogeneous reactions. Sea salt uptake of SO2 reduces the magnitude of TOA aerosol cooling by 0.5 - 1 W m(-2) over the oceans around 60 degrees N in the present-day and year 2100 scenarios. Near dust sources, mineral dust uptake of SO2 and HNO3 leads to less anthropogenic aerosol cooling by 0.5 - 1 W m(-2) in the present-day and 1 - 2 W m(-2) in year 2100.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone and aerosols are radiatively important trace species, whose concentrations have increased dramatically since preindustrial times and are projected to continue to change in the future. The evolution of ozone and aerosol concentrations from 1860 to 2100 is simulated on the basis of estimated historical emissions and four different future emission scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2, A1B, B1, and A1FI). The simulations suggest that the tropospheric burden of ozone has increased by 50\% and sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol burdens have increased by factors of 3 and 6, respectively, since preindustrial times. Projected ozone changes over the next century range from -6\% to + 43\%, depending on the emissions scenario. Sulfate concentrations are projected to increase for the next several decades but then to decrease by 2100 to 4-45\% below their 2000 values. Simulated ozone concentrations agree well with present-day observations and recent trends. Preindustrial surface concentrations of ozone are shown to be sensitive to the assumed anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions, but in all cases they overestimate the few available measurements from that era. Simulated tropospheric burdens of aerosols are sensitive by up to a factor of 2 to assumptions about the rate of aerosol wet deposition in the model. The concentrations of ozone and aerosols produced by this study are provided as climate-forcing agents in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory coupled climate model to estimate their effects on climate. The aerosol distributions from this study and the resulting optical depths are evaluated in a companion paper by P. Ginoux et al. (2006).},

	abstract = {A large number of published and unpublished measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements have been analyzed. AOT measurements were obtained mostly from the AERONET network, and selected to be collocated as closely as possible to the CCN investigations. In remote marine regions, CCN0.4 (CCN at a supersaturation of 0.4\%) are around 110 cm(-3) and the mean AOT(500) (AOT at 500 nm) is 0.057. Over remote continental areas, CCN are almost twice as abundant, while the mean AOT500 is ca. 0.075. (Sites dominated by desert dust plumes were excluded from this analysis.) Some, or maybe even most of this difference must be because even remote continental sites are in closer proximity to pollution sources than remote marine sites. This suggests that the difference between marine and continental levels must have been smaller before the advent of anthropogenic pollution.Over polluted marine and continental regions, the CCN concentrations are about one order of magnitude higher than over their remote counterparts, while AOT is about five times higher over polluted than over clean regions. The average CCN concentrations from all studies show a remarkable correlation to the corresponding AOT values, which can be expressed as a power law. This can be very useful for the parameterization of CCN concentrations in modeling studies, as it provides an easily measured proxy for this variable, which is difficult to measure directly. It also implies that, at least at large scales, the radiative and microphysical effects of aerosols on cloud physics are correlated and not free to vary fully independently. While the observed strong empirical correlation is remarkable, it must still be noted that there is about a factor-of-four range of CCN concentrations at a given AOT, and that there remains considerable room for improvement in remote sensing techniques for CCN abundance.},

Using the spatial and temporal distribution of precursor emissions, we simulated tropospheric ozone from 1890 to 1990 using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) chemistry model. Archived three-dimensional ozone fields were then used in transient GISS climate model simulations. This enables more realistic evaluation of the impact of tropospheric ozone increases than prior simulations using an interpolation between preindustrial and present-day ozone. We find that tropospheric ozone contributed to the greater 20th-century warming in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics compared with the tropics and in the tropics compared with the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Additionally, ozone increased more rapidly during the latter half of the century than the former, causing more rapid warming during that time. This is especially apparent in the tropics and is consistent with observations, which do not show similar behavior in the extratropics. Other climate forcings do not substantially accelerate warming rates in the tropics relative to other regions. This suggests that accelerated tropospheric ozone increases related to industrialization in the developing world have contributed to the accelerated tropical warming. During boreal summer, tropospheric ozone causes enhanced warming ({\textgreater}0.5 degrees C) over polluted northern continental regions. Finally, the Arctic climate response to tropospheric ozone increases is large during fall, winter, and spring when ozone's lifetime is comparatively long and pollution transported from midlatitudes is abundant. The model indicates that tropospheric ozone could have contributed about 0.3 degrees C annual average and about 0.4 degrees C-0.5 degrees C during winter and spring to the 20th-century Arctic warming. Pollution controls could thus substantially reduce the rapid rate of Arctic warming.},

Here, we use tropospheric ozone and cloud data from several instruments in the A-train constellation of satellites as well as information from the GEOS-5 Data Assimilation System to accurately estimate the radiative effect of tropospheric O-3 for January and July 2005. Since we cannot distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources with the satellite data, our derived radiative effect reflects the unadjusted (instantaneous) effect of the total tropospheric O-3 rather than the anthropogenic component. We improve upon previous estimates of tropospheric ozone mixing ratios from a residual approach using the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) by incorporating cloud pressure information from OMI. We focus specifically on the magnitude and spatial structure of the cloud effect on both the short- and long-wave radiative budget. The estimates presented here can be used to evaluate the various aspects of model-generated radiative forcing. For example, our derived cloud impact is to reduce the radiative effect of tropospheric ozone by similar to 16\%. This is centered within the published range of model-produced cloud effect on unadjusted ozone radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Global warming is becoming a reality, with growing evidence that anthropogenic activity on our planet is starting to influence our climate (IPCC, 2001). Due to the increase in significant weather-related disasters in recent years, it is important to investigate the role of global warming on such changes. In this paper we attempt to estimate the long term trends in lightning activity over tropical Africa during the past 50 years, using upper tropospheric water vapor as a proxy for regional lightning activity. We use the NCAR/NCEP reanalysis product available for the period 1948 to the present to estimate the long term trends in lightning activity. Similarity between the long term African lightning variability and observed rainfall and river discharge variability are demonstrated. Since 1950 the inferred lightning activity over Africa shows significant variability, reaching a maximum during the 1960s, followed by a decrease in activity during the following 30 years.},

	abstract = {Radiative forcings, preindustrial to present, are presented due to changes in both tropospheric and total ozone. Unlike previous studies, we use a combination of present-day satellite data, ozonsondes, and a chemistry model to produce a hybrid monthly mean ozone data set from 1870 to 1990. We calculate the radiative forcing due to the prescribed ozone distribution using a three-dimensional climate model that employs seasonally evolving fixed dynamical heating in the stratosphere. We find that tropospheric ozone causes a seasonal fixed dynamical radiative forcing (SEFDH) of 0.30 W m(-2) over the time period 1870-1990. The spatial pattern of forcing is correlated strongly with the change in tropospheric ozone. When we allow for observed changes in stratospheric ozone we calculate that the forcing due to total ozone from 1870 to 1990 is 0.29 W m(-2), with 0.18 from shortwave and 0.11 W m(-2) from longwave processes. Thus reduction of stratospheric ozone since 1970 offsets the forcing by only -0.01 W m(-2). We also consider to what extent increased tropospheric ozone offsets the direct forcing by sulfate aerosols. We find that for June-July-August the sulfate forcing is -0.76 W m(-2), while the addition of ozone forcing reduces this to -0.40 W m(-2). Finally, we carry out sensitivity studies with regard to the uncertainty in preindustrial ozone levels.},

Comparisons of temperature, diurnal temperature range, insolation, Bowen ratio, response to semiannual forcing, inundation fraction, boundary layer relative humidity and associated cloud base height are all self consistent in showing a more continental surface for Africa than South America. These surface characteristics are shown to play a major role in the substantial contrast (annual ratio 2.8) in lightning flash rate density between the two major drainage basins in these two continents. The Congo is slightly hotter and slightly drier than the Amazon, with a contrast in wet bulb potential temperature and convective available potential energy that is difficult to resolve given limitations in the observations. Aerosol effects in cloud microphysics may be needed to account for quantitative shortfalls in explanations for lightning and rainfall on the basis of thermodynamics alone. Additional information about aerosols is needed to clarify their role. The clear African dominance in lightning and Schumann resonance intensity presents a paradox for the behavior of the 'dc'global electrical circuit that is resolvable by dominance of electrified shower clouds in South America, as hypothesized by Wilson.

Speciated sector- and region-specific 2030 emission factors were developed to produce gas and particle emission inventories that followed Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B and B1 emission trajectories. Current and future climate model simulations were run, in which anthropogenic emission changes affected climate, which fed back to natural emissions from lightning (NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, N2O, H2O2, HO2, CO), soils (dust, bacteria, NO, N2O, H-2, CH4, H2S, DMS, OCS, CS2), the ocean (bacteria, sea spray, DMS, N2O, H-2, CH4), vegetation (pollen, spores, isoprene, monoterpenes, methanol, other VOCs), and photosynthesis/respiration. New methods were derived to calculate lightning flash rates as a function of size-resolved collisions and other physical principles and pollen, spore, and bacteria emissions. Although the B1 scenario was "cleaner” than the A1B scenario, global warming increased more in the B1 scenario because much A1B warming was masked by additional reflective aerosol particles. Thus neither scenario is entirely beneficial from a climate and health perspective, and the best control measure is to reduce warming gases and warming/cooling particles together. Lightning emissions declined by similar to 3\% in the B1 scenario and similar to 12\% in the A1B scenario as the number of ice crystals, thus charge-separating bounceoffs, decreased. Net primary production increased by similar to 2\% in both scenarios. Emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes increased by similar to 1\% in the A1B scenario and 4-5\% in the B1 scenario. Near-surface ozone increased by similar to 14\% in the A1B scenario and similar to 4\% in the B1 scenario, reducing ambient isoprene in the latter case. Gases from soils increased in both scenarios due to higher temperatures. Near-surface PM2.5 mass increased by similar to 2\% in the A1B scenario and decreased by similar to 2\% in the B1 scenario. The resulting 1.4\% higher aerosol optical depths (AODs) in the A1B scenario decreased ocean wind speeds and thus ocean sea spray and bacteria emissions; similar to 5\% lower AODs in the B1 scenario had the opposite effect.},

	abstract = {A global three-dimensional model of tropospheric chemistry is used to investigate the changes in tropospheric O-3 and OH since preindustrial times as a result of fuel combustion and industry, biomass burning, and growth in atmospheric CH4. Model results indicate a 63\% increase of the global tropospheric O-3 burden from preindustrial times to present (80\% and 50\% in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively). Anthropogenic emissions of NOx and of CO and hydrocarbons make comparable contributions to the global O-3 increase (60\% and 40\% respectively), even though the local rate of tropospheric O-3 production is generally NOx limited. The rise in O-3 production parallels closely the rise in the emissions of CO and hydrocarbon because the O-3 yield per mole of CO or hydrocarbon oxidized has remained constant at 0.7-0.8 mol/mol since preindustrial times. In contrast, the O-3 production efficiency per mole of NOx emitted has decreased globally by a factor of 2. We find a 9\% decrease in the global mean OH concentration (mass-weighted) since preindustrial times. A linear relationship is found in the model between the global mean OH concentration and the S-N/S-C(3/2) ratio, where S-N and S-C are the sources of NOx and of CO and hydrocarbons, respectively. The relative constancy of the global mean OH concentration since preindustrial times reflects the conservation of the S-N/S-C(3/2) ratio despite large increases in both S-N and S-C. Comparisons of model results with reconstructed nineteenth century observations of O-3 at continental sites indicate a systematic overestimate of about 5 ppbv. Correcting this overestimate would require either a large missing chemical sink for O-3 or a downward revision of the natural NOx source from lightning (3 Tg N yr(-1) in our model). The nineteenth century observations of O-3 Over France show no vertical gradient between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, which is inconsistent with our current understanding of tropospheric O-3 The model underestimates preindustrial CO concentrations derived from polar ice cores; these measurements are difficult to reconcile with any reasonable CO emission inventories.},

During the first thousand years (0 to 1000 A.D.), delta(13)CH(4) was at least 2 per mil enriched compared to expected values, and during the following 700 years, an about 2 per mil depletion occurred. Our modeled methane source partitioning implies that biomass burning emissions were high from 0 to 1000 A.D. but reduced by almost similar to 40\% over the next 700 years. We suggest that both human activities and natural climate change influenced preindustrial biomass burning emissions and that these emissions have been previously understated in late preindustrial Holocene methane budget research.},

	abstract = {A new technique called cloud slicing has been developed for measuring upper tropospheric O-3. Cloud slicing takes advantage of the opaque property of water vapor clouds to ultraviolet wavelength radiation. Measurements of above-cloud column O-3 from the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument are combined together with Nimbus 7 temperature-humidity and infrared radiometer (THIR) cloud-top pressure data to derive O-3 column amounts in the upper troposphere. In this study, tropical TOMS and THIR data for the period 1979-1984 are analyzed. By combining total tropospheric column ozone (referred to as TCO) measurements from the convective cloud differential (CCD) method with 100- to 400-hPa upper tropospheric column O-3 amounts from cloud slicing, it is possible to estimate 400- to 1000-hPa lower tropospheric column O-3 and evaluate its spatial and temporal variability. Results for both the upper and lower tropical troposphere show a year-round zonal wave number 1 pattern in column O-3 with the largest amounts in the Atlantic region (up to similar to 15 DU in the 100- to 400-hPa pressure band and similar to 25-30 DU in the 400- to 1000-hPa pressure band). Upper tropospheric O-3 derived from cloud slicing shows maximum column amounts in the Atlantic region in the June-August and September-November seasons which are similar to the seasonal variability of CCD-derived TCO in the region. For the lower troposphere, the largest column amounts occur in the September-November season over Brazil in South America and also southern Africa. Localized increases in the tropics in the lower tropospheric O-3 are found over the northern region of South America around August and off the west coast of equatorial Africa in the March-May season. Time series analysis for several regions in South America and Africa show an anomalous increase in O-3 in the lower troposphere around the month of March which is not observed in the upper troposphere. The eastern Pacific indicates weak seasonal variability of upper, lower, and total tropospheric O-3 compared with the western Pacific, which shows the largest TCO amounts in both hemispheres around spring months. O-3 variability in the western Pacific is expected to have greater variability caused by strong convection, pollution and biomass burning, land-sea contrast, and monsoon developments.},

The model reproduces the observed NO2/NO concentration ratio to within 30\% and has similar success in simulating observed concentrations of peroxides H2O2, CH3OOH), lending confidence in its use to investigate ozone chemistry. It is found that chemical production of ozone balances only half of chemical loss in the tropospheric column over the tropical South Pacific. The net loss is 1.8 x 10(11) molecules cm(-2) s(-1),The missing source of ozone is matched by westerly transport of continental pollution into the region. Independent analysis of the regional ozone budget with a global three-dimensional model corroborates the results from the point model and reveals the importance of biomass burning emissions in South America and Africa for the ozone budget over the tropical South Pacific. In this model; biomass burning increases average ozone concentrations by 7-8 ppbv throughout the troposphere. The NOx responsible for ozone production within the South Pacific troposphere below 4 km can be largely explained by decomposition of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) transported into the region with biomass burning pollution at higher altitudes.},

	abstract = {We present here a fully coupled global aerosol and chemistry model for the troposphere. The model is used to assess the interactions between aerosols and chemical oxidants in the troposphere, including (1) the conversion from gas-phase oxidants into the condensed phase during the formation of aerosols, ( 2) the heterogeneous reactions occurring on the surface of aerosols, and ( 3) the effect of aerosols on ultraviolet radiation and photolysis rates. The present study uses the global three-dimensional chemical/transport model, Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 2 (MOZART-2), in which aerosols are coupled with the model. The model accounts for the presence of sulfate, soot, primary organic carbon, ammonium nitrate, secondary organic carbon, sea salt, and mineral dust particles. The simulated global distributions of the aerosols are analyzed and evaluated using satellite measurements (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and surface measurements. The results suggest that in northern continental regions the tropospheric aerosol loading is highest in Europe, North America, and east Asia. Sulfate, organic carbon, black carbon, and ammonium nitrate are major contributions for the high aerosol loading in these regions. Aerosol loading is also high in the Amazon and in Africa. In these areas the aerosols consist primarily of organic carbon and black carbon. Over the southern high-latitude ocean (around 60degreesS), high concentrations of sea-salt aerosol are predicted. The concentration of mineral dust is highest over the Sahara and, as a result of transport, spread out into adjacent regions. The model and MODIS show similar geographical distributions of aerosol particles. However, the model overestimates the sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol in the eastern United States, Europe, and east Asia. In the region where aerosol loading is high, aerosols have important impacts on tropospheric ozone and other oxidants. The model suggests that heterogeneous reactions of HO2 and CH2O on sulfate have an important impact on HOx (OH + HO2) concentrations, while the heterogeneous reaction of O-3 on soot has a minor effect on O-3 concentrations in the lower troposphere. The heterogeneous reactions on dust have very important impacts on HOx and O-3 in the region of dust mobilization, where the reduction of HOx and O-3 concentrations can reach a maximum of 30\% and 20\%, respectively, over the Sahara desert. Dust, organic carbon, black carbon, and sulfate aerosols have important impacts on photolysis rates. For example, the photodissociation frequencies of ozone and nitrogen dioxide are reduced by 20\% at the surface in the Sahara, in the Amazon, and in eastern Asia, leading to 5-20\% reduction in the concentration of HOx and to a few percent change in the O-3 abundance in these regions.},

The semi-permanent Pacific High and Aleutian Low cause splitting of transpacific pollution plumes over the Northeast Pacific. The northern branch circulates around the Aleutian Low and has little impact on North America. The southern branch circulates around the Pacific High and some of that air impacts western North America. Both aircraft measurements and model results show sustained ozone production driven by peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) decomposition in the southern branch, roughly doubling the transpacific influence from ozone produced in the Asian boundary layer. Model simulation of ozone observations at Mt. Bachelor Observatory in Oregon (2.7 km altitude) indicates a mean Asian ozone pollution contribution of 9 +/- 3 ppbv to the mean observed concentration of 54 ppbv, reflecting mostly an enhancement in background ozone rather than episodic Asian plumes. Asian pollution enhanced surface ozone concentrations by 5-7 ppbv over western North America in spring 2006. The 2000-2006 rise in Asian anthropogenic emissions increased this influence by 1-2 ppbv.},

Calculations suggest that ozone changes resulting from climate change only are negative in a large fraction of the troposphere because of enhanced photochemical destruction by water vapor. In the Tropics, increased lightning activity should lead to larger ozone concentrations. The magnitude of the climate-induced ozone changes in the troposphere remains smaller than the changes produced by enhanced anthropogenic emissions when the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2P is adopted to describe the future evolution of these emissions. Predictions depend strongly on future trends in atmospheric methane levels, which are not well established. Changes in the emissions of NOx by bacteria in soils and of nonmethane hydrocarbons by vegetation associated with climate change could have a significant impact on future ozone levels.},

Based on IPCC scenario A2, year 2100 ozone, aerosols, and climate simulated with full chemistry-aerosol-climate coupling are compared with those simulated from a stepwise approach. In the stepwise method year 2100 ozone and aerosols are first simulated using present-day climate and year 2100 emissions (denoted as simulation CHEM2100sw) and year 2100 climate is then predicted using offline monthly fields of O-3 and aerosols from CHEM2100sw (denoted as simulation CLIM2100sw). The fully coupled chemistry-aerosol-climate simulation predicts a 15\% lower global burden of O3 for year 2100 than the simulation CHEM2100sw which does not account for future changes in climate. Relative to CHEM2100sw, year 2100 column burdens of all aerosols in the fully coupled simulation exhibit reductions of 10-20 mg m(-2) in DJF and up to 10 mg m(-2) in JJA in mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, reductions of up to 20 mg m(-2) over the eastern United States, northeastern China, and Europe in DJF, and increases of 30-50 mg m(-2) over populated and biomass burning areas in JJA. As a result, relative to year 2100 climate simulated from CLIM2100sw, full chemistry-aerosol-climate coupling leads to a stronger net global warming by greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone and aerosols in year 2100, with a global and annual mean surface air temperature higher by 0.42 K. For simulation of year 2100 aerosols, we conclude that it is important to consider the positive feedback between future aerosol direct radiative forcing and future aerosol concentrations; increased aerosol concentrations lead to reductions in convection and precipitation (or wet deposition of aerosols), further increasing lower tropospheric aerosol concentrations.},

	abstract = {Volcanic eruptions are an important natural cause of climate change on many timescales. A new capability to predict the climatic response to a large tropical eruption for the succeeding 2 years will prove valuable to society. In addition, to detect and attribute anthropogenic influences on climate, including effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone-depleting chemicals, it is crucial to quantify the natural fluctuations so as to separate them from anthropogenic fluctuations in the climate record. Studying the responses of climate to volcanic eruptions also helps us to better understand important radiative and dynamical processes that respond in the climate system to both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Furthermore, modeling the effects of volcanic eruptions helps us to improve climate models that are needed to study anthropogenic effects. Large volcanic eruptions inject sulfur gases into the stratosphere, which convert to sulfate aerosols with an e-folding residence time of about 1 year. Large ash particles fall out much quicker. The radiative and chemical effects of this aerosol cloud produce responses in the climate system. By scattering some solar radiation back to space, the aerosols cool the surface, but by absorbing both solar and terrestrial radiation, the aerosol layer heats the stratosphere. For a tropical eruption this heating is larger in the tropics than in the high latitudes, producing an enhanced pole-to-equator temperature gradient, especially in winter. In the Northern Hemisphere winter this enhanced gradient produces a stronger polar vortex, and this stronger jet stream produces a characteristic stationary wave pattern of tropospheric circulation, resulting in winter warming of Northern Hemisphere continents. This indirect advective effect on temperature is stronger than the radiative cooling effect that dominates at lower latitudes and in the summer. The volcanic aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemical reactions that destroy stratospheric ozone, which lowers ultraviolet absorption and reduces the radiative heating in the lower stratosphere, but the net effect is still heating. Because this chemical effect depends on the presence of anthropogenic chlorine, it has only become important in recent decades. For a few days after an eruption the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of surface air temperature is reduced under the cloud. On a much longer timescale, volcanic effects played a large role in interdecadal climate change of the Little Ice Age. There is no perfect index of past volcanism, but more ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica will improve the record. There is no evidence that volcanic eruptions produce El Nino events, but the climatic effects of El Nino and volcanic eruptions must be separated to understand the climatic response to each.},

Lightning storms before Mei-Yu onset show higher probability of lightning, higher flash rate, and larger radar reflectivity in the mixed-phase region than the Mei-Yu regime. However, the probability of lightning occurrence with the same threshold of maximum radar reflectivity or ice scattering signature is similar for land systems before and during Mei-Yu season. Oceanic systems show slightly lower probability of lightning even with the same thresholds. Relationships between a set of TRMM-observed parameters and LIS lightning frequency are further examined. For lightning systems over land, the total area of radar echo above 35 dBZ has a closer relationship with lightning flash rate at the temperature between -5 degrees C and -15 degrees C than other parameters. Area of lower radar reflectivity at colder temperature, e. g., area of 20 dBZ at -40 degrees C, is also highly correlated with lightning frequency. The highest correlation between area of specific radar reflectivity and lightning frequency is found at lower temperatures when the oceanic lightning systems are examined.},

Lightning data are well suited to study storm activity in and around large urban areas since their continuity and coverage in space and time is superior to historical, spatially limited records of thunderstorm activity. Frequency of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes (of negative and positive polarity) in the area immediately upwind, within, and immediately downwind of the cities were compared. An enhancement of lightning frequency on the order of 40\%-85\% was found over and downwind of many of these cities.A number of possible urban-related causal factors were examined including effects of increased urban concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei, urban population and size, and the presence of distinct topographic features in and around the cities. Various factors, physical and anthropogenic, appeared to interact in diverse ways to account for changes in lightning flash frequency. The enhancement of lightning activity was largest during the afternoon hours when the urban-rural temperature differences are usually smallest, but when the atmosphere is generally the most unstable and when there is often a maximum in convective activity. The spatial distribution of the first 50 lightning flashes from each storm suggested that the urban area did not initiate new lightning storms. Thus, the overall results suggested that existing thunderstorms were the most strongly affected.},

	abstract = {This study provides a very clear picture of the microphysics and flow field in a convective storm in the Rondonia region of Brazil through a synthesis of observations from two unique radars, measurements of the surface drop size distribution (DSD), and particle types and sizes from an aircraft penetration. The primary findings are 1) the growth of rain by the collision-coalescence-breakup (CCB) process to equilibrium drop size distributions entirely below the 0degreesC level; 2) the subsequent growth of larger ice particles (graupel and hail) at subfreezing temperatures; 3) the paucity of lightning activity during the former process, and the increased lightning frequency during the latter; 4) the occurrence of strong downdrafts and a downburst during the latter phase of the storm resulting from cooling by melting and evaporation; 5) the occurrence of turbulence along the main streamlines of the storm; and 6) the confirmation of the large drops reached during the CCB growth by polarimetric radar observations. These interpretations have been made possible by estimating the updraft magnitude using the "lower bound” of the Doppler spectrum at vertical incidence, and identifying the "balance level” at which particles are supported for growth. The combination of these methods shows where raindrops are supported for extended periods to allow their growth to equilibrium drop size distributions, while smaller drops ascend and large ones descend. A hypothesis worthy of pursuit is the control of the storm motion by the winds at the balance level, which is the effective precipitation generating level. Above the 0degreesC level the balance level separates the small ascending ice crystals from the large descending graupel and hail. Collisions between the two cause electrical charging, while gravity and the updrafts separate the charges to cause lightning. Below the 0degreesC level, large downward velocities (caused by the above-mentioned cooling) in excess of the terminal fall speeds of raindrops represent the downbursts, which are manifested in the surface winds.},

	abstract = {Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei(1). The resulting cooling tendency, termed the indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud populations are poorly understood(2). Smaller cloud droplets not only reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which is expected to result in increased cloud water(3,4). Such an increase in cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more water(5-7). Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations. Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air. In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing.},

	abstract = {In-situ ice crystal size distribution measurements are presented within the tropical troposphere and lower stratosphere. The measurements were performed using a combination of a Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP-100) and a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP), which were installed on the Russian high altitude research aircraft M55 "Geophysica" during the SCOUT-O-3 campaign in Darwin, Australia. One of the objectives of the campaign was to characterise the Hector convective system, which appears on an almost daily basis during the pre-monsoon season over the Tiwi Islands, north of Darwin. In total 90 encounters with ice clouds, between 10 and 19 km altitude were selected from the dataset and were analysed. Six of these encounters were observed in the lower stratosphere, up to 1.4 km above the local tropopause. Concurrent lidar measurements on board "Geophysica" indicate that these ice clouds were a result of overshooting convection. Large ice crystals, with a maximum dimension up to 400 mu m, were observed in the stratosphere. The stratospheric ice clouds included an ice water content ranging from 7.7x10(-5) to 8.5x10(-4) gm(-3) and were observed at ambient relative humidities ( with respect to ice) between 75 and 157\%. Three modal lognormal size distributions were fitted to the average size distributions for different potential temperature intervals, showing that the shape of the size distribution of the stratospheric ice clouds are similar to those observed in the upper troposphere.In the tropical troposphere the effective radius of the ice cloud particles decreases from 100 mu m at about 10 km altitude, to 3 mu m at the tropopause, while the ice water content decreases from 0.04 to 10(-5) gm(-3). No clear trend in the number concentration was observed with altitude, due to the thin and inhomogeneous characteristics of the observed cirrus clouds.The ice water content calculated from the observed ice crystal size distribution is compared to the ice water content derived from two hygrometer instruments. This independent measurement of the ice water content agrees within the combined uncertainty of the instruments for ice water contents exceeding 3x10(-4) gm(-3).Stratospheric residence times, calculated based on gravitational settling, and evaporation rates show that the ice crystals observed in the stratosphere over the Hector storm system had a high potential of humidifying the stratosphere locally.Utilizing total aerosol number concentration measurements from a four channel condensation particle counter during two separate campaigns, it can be shown that the fraction of ice particles to the number of aerosol particles remaining ranges from 1: 300 to 1: 30 000 for tropical upper tropospheric ice clouds with ambient temperatures below -75 degrees C.},

However, since most models do not incorporate the aerosol indirect effects, model agreement with observations may be partly spurious. The incorporation of more detailed aerosol effects in future models could lead to inconsistencies between simulated and observed past warming, unless the effects are small or compensated by additional forcings. It is argued that parameter correlations across models are neither unexpected nor problematic if the models are interpreted as conditional on observations.},

The spatial distributions of modeled and National Lightning Detection Network-based flash rates during the summers of 2004-2006 agree well (R-2 = 0.49, 18\% low bias). Despite this reasonable agreement, 9-12 km model NOx during the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX-A) campaign is a factor of 2.2-3.6 too low for a simulation that includes a 480 mol per flash midlatitude lightning NO source, the source that provides the best agreement with measurements. Possible causes of this low bias include biases in model convection and/or too rapid NOx chemistry in the upper troposphere. Model tropospheric NO2 columns over the southeastern United States during these summers show a 7\% high bias with respect to the OMI DOMINO/GEOS-Chem tropospheric column NO2 product. Observed changes between 2004 and 2006 in upper tropospheric ozone at southeastern U. S. INTEX Ozonesonde Network Study sites are captured by the model and appear to be caused by a stronger upper tropospheric anticyclone in 2006 that led to an increase from 21 to 30 ppbv between 2004 and 2006 in the amount of ozone with a lightning NO source; lightning NO emissions were 15\%-20\% larger in 2004. The contribution of lightning NO to monthly average summertime 300 hPa NOx over the eastern United States during 2004-2006 varies from 61\%-73\% (0.09-0.16 ppbv), while the contribution to ozone varies from 19\%-31\% (15-24 ppbv).},

The doubly periodic grid has 1536 X 1536 X 256 grid cells with horizontal grid spacing of 100 m, thus covering an area of 154 X 154 km(2). The vertical resolution varies from 50 m in the boundary layer to 100 m in the free troposphere and gradually coarsens to 250 m near the domain top at 25.4 km. The length of the simulation is 6 h, starting from an early morning sounding corresponding to 0730 local time. Convection is forced by prescribed surface latent and sensible heat fluxes and prescribed horizontally uniform radiative heatingDespite a considerable amount of convective available potential energy (CAPE) in the range of 1600-2400 J kg(-1), and despite virtually no convective inhibition (CIN) in the mean sounding throughout the simulation, the cumulus convection starts as shallow, gradually developing into congestus, and becomes deep only toward the end of simulation. Analysis shows that the reason is that the shallow clouds generated by the boundary layer turbulence are too small to penetrate deep into the troposphere, as they are quickly diluted by mixing with the environment. Precipitation and the associated cold pools are needed to generate thermals big enough to support the growth of deep clouds. This positive feedback involving precipitation is supported by a sensitivity experiment in which the cold pools are effectively eliminated by artificially switching off the evaporation of precipitation; in the experiment, the convection remains shallow throughout the entire simulation, with a few congestus but no deep clouds.The probability distribution function (PDF) of cloud size during the shallow, congestus, and deep phases is analyzed using a new method. During each of the three phases, the shallow clouds dominate the mode of the PDFs at about 1-km diameter. During the deep phase, the PDFs show cloud bases as wide as 4 km. Analysis of the joint PDFs of cloud size and in-cloud variables demonstrates that, as expected, the bigger clouds are far less diluted above their bases than their smaller counterparts. Also, thermodynamic properties at cloud bases are found to be nearly identical for all cloud sizes, with the moist static energy exceeding the mean value by as much as 4 kJ kg(-1). The width of the moist static energy distribution in the boundary layer is mostly due to variability of water vapor; therefore, clouds appear to grow from the air with the highest water vapor content available.No undiluted cloudy parcels are found near the level of neutral buoyancy. It appears that a simple entraining-plume model explains the entrainment rates rather well. The least diluted plumes in the simulation correspond to an entrainment parameter of about 0.1 km(-1).},

Progress includes new observing techniques (including isotopic methods) that are helping to illuminate moisture-convection interaction, better observed humidity trends, new modeling approaches, and clearer expectations as to the hydrological consequences of increased specific humidity in a warmer climate. A theory appears to be in place to predict humidity in the free troposphere if winds are known at large scales, providing a crucial link between small-scale behavior and large-scale mass and energy constraints. This, along with observations, supports the anticipated water vapor feedback on climate, though key uncertainties remain connected to atmospheric dynamics and the hydrological consequences of a moister atmosphere. More work is called for to understand how circulations on all scales are governed and what role water vapor plays. Suggestions are given for future research.},

This model feature is consistent with the few observations from commercial aircraft in the region. Its origin in the model reflects a complex interplay of dynamical and chemical factors, and of anthropogenic and natural influences. The anticyclonic circulation in the middle and upper troposphere over the Middle East funnels northern midlatitude pollution transported in the westerly subtropical jet as well as lightning outflow from the Indian monsoon and pollution from eastern Asia transported in an easterly tropical jet. Large-scale subsidence over the region takes place with continued net production Of O-3 and little mid-level outflow. Transport from the stratosphere does not contribute significantly to the 03 maximum. Sensitivity simulations with anthropogenic or lightning emissions shut off indicate decreases of 20-30\% and 10-15\% respectively in the tropospheric O-3 column over the Middle East. More observations in this region are needed to confirm the presence of the O-3 maximum.},

	abstract = {Aerosol interaction with clouds is the main uncertainty for the quantification of the anthropogenic forcing on climate. The first step of the so-called "aerosol indirect effect" is the change of cloud droplet size distribution when seeded by anthropogenic aerosols. Satellite data provide the density and diversity of observations needed for a statistical estimate of this effect. Numerous such studies have demonstrated the correlation between aerosol load and Cloud Droplet Radius (CDR) and a few have quantified the impact of aerosol on the microphysics. Here, we go one step further by using the profiles from the spaceborne CALIPSO lidar that indicates the respective position of aerosol and cloud layers. The results show that, when aerosol and cloud layers are clearly separated, there is no correlation between aerosol load and CDR. On the other hand, when the lidar profile indicates mixing, there is a strong correlation. We focus on the stratocumulus cloud fields off the coast of Namibia and Angola that are seeded by biomass burning aerosols from Africa. The log-log slope of CDR and a proxy of the condensation nuclei number are -0.24 in excellent agreement with theoretical estimate. When the vertical profile information is not used, the slope is significantly smaller. Citation: Costantino, L., and F.-M.

	abstract = {The climatological conditions that are favorable to thunderstorm cloud development in the coastal zone of French Guyana are investigated. The analysis reveals that both the thunderstorm occurrence and the mean monthly lightning frequency are correlated to the Intertropical Convergence Zone annual oscillation, thus increasing from March to August when the South-East trade-wind flux drives continental air masses towards French Guyana and decreasing from September to February when French Guyana is under the influence of maritime air masses driven by the North-East trade-wind. The study of the lightning frequency values, observed during individual thunderstorm events, as a function of the cloud-top height shows that these values are intermediate to the lightning frequency values deduced from the parameterizations proposed by Price and Rind (1992) for typical continental and maritime thunderstorm clouds of a similar height. This behavior suggests that the air masses in which thunderstorm clouds develop in the French Guyana coast are mixed air masses with intermediate characteristics. Further, the absence of correlation between the lightning frequency values and both the cloud-top heights and the corresponding convective available potential energy (CAFE) values indicates that these parameters can not be used to predict lightning activity in these clouds. Most probably, the aerosol concentrations in the subcloud layer and consequently the cloud droplet concentrations play an important role in the development of lightning activity in the considered clouds.},

	abstract = {In this work. a new parameterization of the thunderstorm cloud electrical flash frequency is obtained on the basis of simple dimensional arguments. The flash frequency is expressed as a power function of both the cloud top height and the cloud droplet concentration, thus partly taking into account the role of the microphysical cloud characteristics. Since droplet concentrations are not predicted by General Circulation Models (GCMs) and further show great variability, two different "standard" droplet concentrations, respectively valid for continental and maritime thunderstorms, are used. A numerical experiment has been made by using the METEO-France GCM "ARPEGE" in relation to both, this new parameterization and the Price and Rind (1992) parameterization, in order to determine the global characteristics of electrical flashes. The analysis of the results reveals that the mean annual global flash frequency as well as the total number of flashes that strike annually the globe are higher when the new parameterization is used but are in better agreement with the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) (Christian et at., 1996) observations, thus indirectly attesting for its validity. Further, the good agreement between monthly and diurnal global flash numbers and the corresponding OTD observations confirms the ability of "ARPEGE' of correctly representing the global thunderstorm development. Finally, the new parameterization has been used in a second numerical experiment in order to infer the role of a doubling of CO2 on the global distribution of electrical flashes. A 10\% increase of the mean global annual flash frequency is obtained for a surface warming of roughly 2 degrees C.},

	abstract = {We have addressed the need for improved measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) by developing a continuous-flow instrument that provides in situ measurements of CCN. The design presented in this article can operate between 0.1 and 3\% supersaturation, at sampling rates sufficient for airborne operation. The design constitutes a cylindrical continuous-flow thermal-gradient diffusion chamber employing a novel technique of generating a supersaturation: by establishing a constant streamwise temperature gradient so that the difference in water vapor and thermal diffusivity yield a quasi-uniform centerline supersaturation. Our design maximizes the growth rate of activated droplets, thereby enhancing the performance of the instrument. The temperature gradient and the flow through the column control the supersaturation and may be modified to retrieve CCN spectra.The principle of the CCN instrument was validated in controlled laboratory experiments at different operating conditions using a monodisperse aerosols with known composition and size. These experiments yield sharp activation curves, even for those kinetically limited particles that have not exceeded their critical diameter. The performance of the CCN instrument was also assessed using polydisperse laboratory-generated aerosol of known composition and size distributions similar to ambient particulate matter. In all tests, the measured CCN concentrations compared well with predicted values and highlight the instrument's ability to measure CCN at various size distributions.The full potential of the new design has yet to be explored; however, model simulations suggest that direct measurements in the climatically important range of supersaturations of less than 0.1\% (certainly down to 0.07\%) are possible. The new instrument clearly offers a unique level of design simplicity, robustness, and flexilibity (temperature control, large range of supersaturations without flow reversal, and multiple configurations for same supersaturation) necessary for atmospheric studies.},

	abstract = {The rate at which ozone is increasing in the troposphere is uncertain due to the lack of accurate long-term measurements. Old ozone measurements obtained at the Pic du Midi Observatory (3000 m high, southwestern France) were recently rediscovered. Four sets of data available at this station are presented herein: (1) 1874-1881 and (2) 1881-1909 by the Schonbein method and (3) 1982-1984 and (4) 1990-1993 by UV absorption analyzers. The results show an increase in ozone by a factor of 5 since the beginning of the twentieth century, corresponding to an exponential increase of 1.6\% per year, although this trend is probably higher (2.4\% per year) for the last few decades. A stable 10 ppb ozone mixing ratio is observed during the first 20 years of the series, which is representative of the preindustrial era ozone level. The increase is seen to start around 1895. Other data, obtained at various European high-altitude stations between 1920 and 1980, tie in closely with the Pic du Midi observations. A tentative evaluation of the impact of tropospheric ozone on radiative forcing confirms that ozone is currently the second most significant greenhouse gas, responsible for 22\% and 13\% of radiative forcing changes since 1800 in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. If these rates were to be maintained in the future, ozone would continue to evolve differently in the two hemispheres (maximum level in the northern hemisphere) and could make an even more significant contribution to the radiative forcing of the northern hemisphere.},

Cloud lifetimes are statistically similar although individual clouds may experience decreases in lifetime of 10 - 40\%. An evaporation-entrainment feedback that tends to dilute polluted clouds more than clean clouds is identified. It is proposed that the small changes in cloud lifetime are due to competing effects of precipitation suppression and enhanced evaporation, with the latter tending to dominate in these shallow clouds.},

This observational analysis further indicated that clouds act as a positive feedback in this region on decadal time scales. The observed relationships between cloud cover and regional meteorological conditions provide a more complete way of testing the realism of the cloud simulation in current-generation climate models. The only model that passed this test simulated a reduction in cloud cover over much of the Pacific when greenhouse gases were increased, providing modeling evidence for a positive low-level cloud feedback.},

This version includes a new cloud microphysics scheme, an interactive sulphur cycle, and a parameterization of the effects of sea salt aerosol. The combined global mean radiative impact from both indirect effects is estimated to be approximately -1.9 W m(-2) in terms of the change in net cloud forcing, with the "albedo" effect dominating: we obtain values of -1.3 and -0.5 W m(-2) for the first and second effects, respectively, when calculated separately. The estimate for the combined effect has at least a factor of 2 uncertainty associated with it: for example, alternative assumptions which affect the concentration of natural "background" sulphate aerosol reduce the forcing by over 25\%, and different parameterizations of the autoconversion of cloud droplets to rainwater can double the forcing.},

	abstract = {The most extensive set of free tropospheric ozone measurements ever compiled across midlatitude North America was measured with daily ozonesondes, commercial aircraft and a lidar at 14 sites during July-August 2004. The model estimated stratospheric ozone was subtracted from all profiles, leaving a tropospheric residual ozone. On average the upper troposphere above midlatitude eastern North America contained 15 ppbv more tropospheric residual ozone than the more polluted layer between the surface and 2 km above sea level. Lowest ozone values in the upper troposphere were found above the two upwind sites in California. The upper troposphere above midlatitude eastern North America contained 16 ppbv more tropospheric residual ozone than the upper troposphere above three upwind sites, with the greatest enhancement above Houston, Texas, at 24 ppbv. Upper tropospheric CO measurements above east Texas show no statistically significant enhancement compared to west coast measurements, arguing against a strong influence from fresh surface anthropogenic emissions to the upper troposphere above Texas where the ozone enhancement is greatest. Vertical mixing of ozone from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere can only account for 2 ppbv of the 16 ppbv ozone enhancement above eastern North America; therefore the remaining 14 ppbv must be the result of in situ ozone production. The transport of NOx tracers from North American anthropogenic, biogenic, biomass burning, and lightning emissions was simulated for the upper troposphere of North America with a particle dispersion model. Additional box model calculations suggest the 24 ppbv ozone enhancement above Houston can be produced over a 10 day period from oxidation reactions of lightning NOx and background mixing ratios of CO and CH4. Overall, we estimate that 69-84\% (11-13 ppbv) of the 16 ppbv ozone enhancement above eastern North America is due to in situ ozone production from lightning NOx with the remainder due to transport of ozone from the surface or in situ ozone production from other sources of NOx.},

These budgets are used to estimate a mean diurnal cycle of entrainment and, by diagnosing the fluxes of humidity and liquid water static energy necessary to maintain a mixed-layer structure, of buoyancy flux. Although the entrainment rates suggested by each of the budgets have significant uncertainty, the various methods are consistent in predicting a 6-day mean entrainment rate of 4 +/- 1 mm s(-1), with higher values at night and very little entrainment around local noon. The diurnal cycle of buoyancy flux suggests that drizzle, while only a small term in the boundary layer moisture budget, significantly reduces subcloud buoyancy flux and may induce weak decoupling of surface and cloud-layer turbulence during the earl), morning hours, a structure that is maintained throughout the day by shortwave warming.

In the control experiment, climate is unforced, but emissions of trace gases to the chemical model increase in line with an illustrative scenario for future trace gas emissions with medium high growth. In the climate change experiment trace gas emissions are identical to the control, but climate is also forced using greenhouse gas concentrations and SO2 emissions from the same scenario. Global average methane in the climate change experiment increased from 1670 ppbv in 1990 to 3230 ppbv Ly 2100, compared to 3650 ppbv by 2100 in the control. The methane increase in the control experiment is therefore 27 \% more than in the control. This difference is due to both temperature and OH changes which increase the rate of methane oxidation and act in the opposite direction to the negative feedback of methane on itself through OH. Mid-latitude northern hemisphere ozone concentrations in July for the mid-troposphere rose from 39 ppbv in 1990s to 64 ppbv in the 2090s in the control experiment and to 49 ppbv in the climate change experiment. The direct role of climate change is therefore predicted to be a negative feedback on the radiative forcing from the change to tropospheric ozone and methane concentrations.},

	abstract = {The spatial organization of deep moist convection in radiative-convective equilibrium over a constant sea surface temperature is studied. A 100-day simulation is performed with a three-dimensional cloud-resolving model over a (576 km)(2) domain with no ambient rotation and no mean wind. The convection self-aggregates within 10 days into quasi-stationary mesoscale patches of dry, subsiding and moist, rainy air columns. The patches ultimately merge into a single intensely convecting moist patch surrounded by a broad region of very dry subsiding air.The self-aggregation is analyzed as an instability of a horizontally homogeneous convecting atmosphere driven by convection-water vapor-radiation feedbacks that systematically dry the drier air columns and moisten the moister air columns. Column-integrated heat, water, and moist static energy budgets over (72 km)(2) horizontal blocks show that this instability is primarily initiated by the reduced radiative cooling of air columns in which there is extensive anvil cirrus, augmented by enhanced surface latent and sensible heat fluxes under convectively active regions due to storm-induced gustiness. Mesoscale circulations intensify the later stages of self-aggregation by fluxing moist static energy from the dry to the moist regions. A simple mathematical model of the initial phase of self-aggregation is proposed based on the simulations.In accordance with this model, the self-aggregation can be suppressed by horizontally homogenizing the radiative cooling or surface fluxes. Lower-tropospheric wind shear leads to slightly slower and less pronounced self-aggregation into bands aligned along the shear vector. Self-aggregation is sensitive to the ice microphysical parameterization, which affects the location and extent of cirrus clouds and their radiative forcing. Self-aggregation is also sensitive to ambient Coriolis parameter f, and can induce spontaneous tropical cyclogenesis for large f. Inclusion of an interactive mixed-layer ocean slows but does not prevent self-aggregation.},

Thus, two circulation indices are necessary, which measure the variability of the ISM and WNPSM, respectively. A weak WNPSM features suppressed convection along 10 degrees -20 degreesN and enhanced rainfall along the mei-yu/baiu front. So the WNPSM index also provides a measure for the east Asian summer monsoon. An anomalous WNPSM exhibits a prominent meridional coupling among the Australian high, cross-equatorial flows, WNP monsoon trough, WNP subtropical high, east Asian subtropical front, and Okhotsk high. The WNP monsoon has leading spectral peaks at 50 and 16 months, whereas the Indian monsoon displays a primary peak around 30 months. The WNPSM is weak during the decay of an El Nino, whereas the ISM tends to abate when an El Nino develops. Since the late 1970s, the WNPSM has become more variable, but its relationship with El Nino remained steady; in contrast, the ISM has become less variable and its linkage with El Nino has dramatically declined. These contrasting features are in part attributed to the differing processes of monsoon-ocean interaction.Also found is a teleconnection between a suppressed WNPSM and deficient summer rainfall over the Great Plains of the United States. This boreal summer teleconnection is forced by the heat source fluctuation associated with the WNPSM and appears to be established through excitation of Rossby wave trains and perturbation of the jet stream that further excites downstream optimum unstable modes.},

	abstract = {The behavior and various controls of diurnal variability in tropical-subtropical rainfall are investigated using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation measurements retrieved from the three level-2 TRMM standard profile algorithms for the 1998 annual cycle. Results show that diurnal variability characteristics of precipitation are consistent for all three algorithms, providing assurance that TRMM retrievals are producing consistent estimates of rainfall variability. As anticipated, most ocean areas exhibit more rainfall at night, while over most land areas, rainfall peaks during daytime; however, important exceptions are noted.The dominant feature of the oceanic diurnal cycle is a rainfall maximum in late-evening-early-morning (LE-EM) hours, while over land the dominant maximum occurs in the mid- to late afternoon (MLA). In conjunction with these maxima are pronounced seasonal variations of the diurnal amplitudes. Amplitude analysis shows that the diurnal pattern and its seasonal evolution are closely related to the rainfall accumulation pattern and its seasonal evolution. In addition, the horizontal distribution of diurnal variability indicates that for oceanic rainfall, there is a secondary MLA maximum coexisting with the LE-EM maximum at latitudes dominated by large-scale convergence and deep convection. Analogously, there is a preponderancy for an LE-EM maximum over land coexisting with the stronger MLA maximum, although it is not evident that this secondary continental feature is closely associated with the large-scale circulation. Neither of the secondary maxima exhibit phase behavior that can be considered semidiurnal in nature. Diurnal rainfall variability over the ocean associated with large-scale convection is clearly an integral component of the general circulation.Phase analysis reveals differences in regional and seasonal features of the diurnal cycle, indicating that underlying forcing mechanisms differ from place to place. This is underscored by the appearance of secondary ocean maxima in the presence of large-scale convection, along with other important features. Among these, there are clear-cut differences between the diurnal variability of seasonal rainfall over the mid-Pacific and Indian Ocean Basins. The mid-Pacific exhibits double maxima in spring and winter but only LE-EM maxima in summer and autumn, while the Indian Ocean exhibits double maxima in spring and summer and only an LE-EM maximum in autumn and winter. There are also evident daytime maxima within the major large-scale marine stratocumulus regions off the west coasts of continents. The study concludes with a discussion concerning how the observational evidence either supports or repudiates possible forcing mechanisms that have been suggested to explain diurnal rainfall variability.},

	abstract = {A cloud rift is characterized as a large-scale, persistent area of broken, low-reflectivity stratocumulus clouds usually surrounded by a solid deck of stratocumulus. A rift observed off the coast of California was investigated using an instrumented aircraft to compare the aerosol, cloud microphysical, and thermodynamic properties in the rift with those of the surrounding solid stratocumulus deck. The microphysical characteristics in the solid stratocumulus deck differ substantially from those of a broken, cellular rift where cloud droplet concentrations are a factor of 2 lower than those in the solid cloud. Furthermore, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations were found to be about 3 times greater in the solid-cloud area compared with those in the rift. Although drizzle was observed near cloud top in parts of the solid stratocumulus cloud, the largest drizzle rates were associated with the broken clouds within the rift area and with extremely large effective droplet sizes retrieved from satellite data. Minimal thermodynamic differences between the rift and solid cloud deck were observed. In addition to marked differences in particle concentrations, evidence of a mesoscale circulation near the solid cloud-rift boundary is presented. This mesoscale circulation may provide a mechanism for maintaining a rift, but further study is required to understand the initiation of a rift and the conditions that may cause it to fill. A review of results from previous studies indicates similar microphysical characteristics in rift features sampled serendipitously. These observations indicate that cloud rifts are depleted of aerosols through the cleansing associated with drizzle and are a manifestation of natural processes occurring in marine stratocumulus.},

It produces a profound affect on tropical climate by shading the underlying ocean and radiatively cooling and stirring up turbulence in the atmosphere. In October 2001, the East Pacific Investigation of Climate undertook an exploratory cruise from the Galapagos Islands to Chile. The cruise gathered an unprecedented dataset, integrating radiosonde, surface, cloud remote sensing, aerosol, and ocean measurements. Scientific objectives included measuring the vertical structure of the ABL in this region, understanding what physical processes are determining the stratocumulus cloud albedo, and understanding the fluxes of heat and water that couple the atmosphere and ocean in this region.An unexpectedly well-mixed stratocumulus-capped boundary layer as a result of a strong inversion was encountered throughout. A strong diurnal cycle was observed, with thicker clouds and substantial drizzle (mainly evaporating above the sea surface) during the late night and early morning. This was driven in part by local diabatic processes, and was reinforced by a surprisingly pronounced diurnal cycle of vertical motion. The vertical motion appears to be an inertia-gravity wave driven by daytime heating over South America that propagates over 1000 km offshore. Much more nocturnal drizzle and pronounced mesoscale cellularity were observed in "clean" conditions when cloud droplet concentrations and aerosol concentrations were low. Entrainment of dry, warm air is inferred to be the primary regulator of cloud thickness in this region, but drizzle also appears to have a large indirect impact by inhibiting and changing the spatial organization of turbulence.},

	abstract = {Microphysical and meteorological controls on the formation of open and closed cellular structures in the Southeast Pacific are explored using model simulations based on aircraft observations during the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx). The effectiveness of factors such as boundary-layer moisture and temperature perturbations, surface heat and moisture fluxes, large-scale vertical motion and solar heating in promoting drizzle and open cell formation for prescribed aerosol number concentrations is explored. For the case considered, drizzle and subsequent open cell formation over a broad region are more sensitive to the observed boundary-layer moisture and temperature perturbations (+0.9 g kg(-1); -1 K) than to a five-fold decrease in aerosol number concentration (150 vs. 30 mg(-1)). When embedding the perturbations in closed cells, local drizzle and pockets of open cell (POC) formation respond faster to the aerosol reduction than to the moisture increase, but the latter generates stronger and more persistent drizzle. A local negative perturbation in temperature drives a mesoscale circulation that prevents local drizzle formation but promotes it in a remote area where lower-level horizontal transport of moisture is blocked and converges to enhance liquid water path. This represents a potential mechanism for POC formation in the Southeast Pacific stratocumulus region whereby the circulation is triggered by strong precipitation in adjacent broad regions of open cells. A simulation that attempts to mimic the influence of a coastally induced upsidence wave results in an increase in cloud water but this alone is insufficient to initiate drizzle. An increase of surface sensible heat flux is also effective in triggering local drizzle and POC formation.Both open and closed cells simulated with observed initial conditions exhibit distinct diurnal variations in cloud properties. A stratocumulus deck that breaks up due solely to solar heating can recover at night. Precipitation in the open-cell cases depletes the aerosol to the extent that cloud formation is significantly suppressed within one diurnal cycle. A replenishment rate of cloud condensation nuclei of order 1 mg(-1) h(-1) is sufficient to maintain clouds and prevent the boundary layer from collapsing the following day, suggesting that some local and/or remote aerosol sources is necessary for POCs to be able to last for days.},

	abstract = {[1] Fourteen years ( 1989 - 2002) of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning data show a significant enhancement of lightning associated with Lake Charles and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A peak density value of 7 flashes km(-2) yr(-1) exists on the western side of the Lake Charles urban area. A comparison of the Louisiana CG flash density distribution with the locations of PM10 ( particulate matter less than 10 mm in diameter) sources strongly suggests that pollution plays a key role in lightning enhancement. Urban and sea breeze effects can be neglected. The values of median peak negative current show a sharp difference between land and the Gulf of Mexico; inland values are near 24 kA, while over the Gulf waters immediately offshore are over 30 kA. This observation, along with a relative minimum of negative peak current from the mouth of the Mississippi River southeastward seems to support the hypothesis that the underlying surface characteristics influence the calculated negative current distribution.},

Calibration errors, cloud microphysics and the effect of the Planck function over horizontally inhomogeneous areas cannot explain the observation. Simulations with a line-by-line radiative transfer model show that the larger brightness temperatures in the WV absorption band are due to stratospheric water vapour, which absorbs radiation from the cold cloud top and emits radiation at higher stratospheric temperatures. The brightness temperature difference depends on the amount of water vapour and on the temperature lapse rate in the stratosphere. The temperature difference is largest when the cloud top is at the tropopause temperature inversion. The tropopause temperature in legions of deep convective clouds can he estimated from the brightness temperature differences observed in consecutive images from geostationary satellites. The method also has the potential for monitoring areas of troposphere-stratosphere exchange. (C) 1997 COSPAR.},

	abstract = {A 3-yr (1998-2000) climatology of near-surface rainfall and stratiform rain fraction observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar ( PR) was used to calculate the four-dimensional distribution of tropical latent heating on seasonal-to-annual time scales. The TRMM-derived latent heating was then used to force an idealized primitive equation model using an initial value approach in order to obtain the quasi-steady-state, nonlinear, zonally asymmetric atmospheric response to precipitating tropical cloud systems. In agreement with previous studies, an increase in stratiform rain fraction elevates circulation centers and strengthens the upper-level response. Furthermore, horizontal variations in the vertical heating profile implied by the PR stratiform rain fraction pattern lead to circulation anomalies of varying height and vertical extent that are not present when the model is forced with a vertically uniform heating field. During El Nino, the trans-Pacific gradient in stratiform rain fraction that is normally present becomes more pronounced and the model response becomes even more sensitive to the horizontal variability of the latent heating vertical structure. When the heating field is modified to take into account the effects of nonprecipitating cumulus and cloud radiative forcing within the regions of tropical precipitating cloud systems, the overall pattern of the model response to the TRMM-derived latent heating is reinforced, as is the model's sensitivity to the variability in the latent heating vertical structure.},

We examine how injected aerosol particles that act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are transported within the marine boundary layer and how the additional particles in clouds impact cloud microphysical processes, and feedback on dynamics. Results show that the effectiveness of cloud brightening depends strongly on meteorological and background aerosol conditions. Cloud albedo enhancement is very effective in a weakly precipitating boundary layer and in CCN-limited conditions preceded by heavy and/or persistent precipitation. The additional CCN help sustain cloud water by weakening the precipitation substantially in the former case and preventing the boundary layer from collapse in the latter. For a given amount of injected CCN, the injection method (i.e., number and distribution of sprayers) is critical to the spatial distribution of these CCN. Both the areal coverage and the number concentration of injected particles are key players but neither one always emerges as more important than the other. The same amount of injected material is much less effective in either strongly precipitating clouds or polluted clouds, and it is ineffective in a relatively dry boundary layer that supports clouds of low liquid water path. In the polluted case and "dry" case, the CCN injection increases drop number concentration but lowers supersaturation and liquid water path. As a result, the cloud experiences very weak albedo enhancement, regardless of the injection method.},

	abstract = {Lightning activity over the West Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines is usually much less frequent than over the nearby maritime continents. However, in 2005 the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) aboard the TRMM satellite observed anomalously high lightning activity in that area. In the same year the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) measured anomalously high aerosol loading. The high aerosol loading was traced to volcanic activity, and not to any factor linked to meteorology, disentangling the usual convolution between aerosols and meteorology. We show that in general lightning activity is tightly correlated with aerosol loadings at both inter-annual and biweekly time scales. We estimate that a similar to 60\% increase in aerosol loading leads to more than 150\% increase in lightning flashes. Aerosols increase lightning activity through modification of cloud microphysics. Cloud ice particle sizes are reduced and cloud glaciation is delayed to colder temperature when aerosol loading is increased. TRMM precipitation radar measurements indicate that anomalously high aerosol loading is associated with enhanced cloud mixed phase activity and invigorated convection over the maritime ocean. These observed associations between aerosols, cloud microphysics, morphology and lightning activity are not related to meteorological variables or ENSO events. The results have important implications for understanding the variability of lightning and resulting aerosol-chemistry interactions. Citation: Yuan, T., L. A. Remer, K. E. Pickering, and H.

	abstract = {Each spring, smoke particles from fires over the Yucatan Peninsula and south Mexico cross over the Gulf of Mexico into the United States (US) under the control of moist oceanic air flow from the southwestern branch of the subtropical (Bermuda) high. Smoke can be transported deep into the south central US, where dry lines and warm conveyor belts are frequently formed and cause deep convection and severe weather. Lyons et al (1998 Science 282 77-80) and Murray et al (2000 Geophys. Res. Lett. 27 2249-52) noticed a similar to 50\% increase of lightning along the smoke transport path over the south central US during the May 1998 Central American smoke episode. Here we present a conceptual model of coherent microphysical and meteorological mechanisms through which smoke may impact convective clouds and subsequently result in more severe weather over the south central US. The conceptual model depicts a chain of processes in which smoke particles are first activated as cloud condensation nuclei when they are entrained into the warm conveyor belt, a convective zone formed over the south central US as a result of the encounter between the mid-latitude trough and the subtropical Bermuda high. As the convection continues with deepening of the mid-latitude trough, the greater concentration of water cloud condensation nuclei delays the warm rain processes, enhances the development of ice clouds, and invigorates the updrafts, all of which contribute to the formation of severe weather such as hail and lightning. The conceptual model is based on the reasoning of physical mechanisms revealed in previous studies (over the tropical biomass region), and is supported here through the analysis of satellite data, ground observations, aerosol transport model results, and idealized cloud resolving simulations of a day in May 2003 when record tornado events occurred over the south central US. Further assessment of this conceptual model is discussed for future investigations.},

	abstract = {The existence of the Saharan air layer (SAL), a layer of warm, dry, dusty air frequently present over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, has long been appreciated. The nature of its impacts on hurricanes remains unclear, with some researchers arguing that the SAL amplifies hurricane development and with others arguing that it inhibits it. The potential negative impacts of the SAL include 1) vertical wind shear associated with the African easterly jet: 2) warm air aloft, which increases thermodynamic stability at the base of the SAL; and 3) dry air, which produces cold downdrafts. Multiple NASA satellite datasets and NCEP global analyses are used to characterize the SAL's properties and evolution ill relation to tropical cyclones and to evaluate these potential negative influences. The SAL is shown to occur in a large-scale environment that is already characteristically dry as a result of large-scale subsidence. Strong surface heating and deep dry convective mixing enhance the dryness at low levels (primarily below similar to 700 hPa), but moisten the air at midlevels. Therefore, mid-to-upper-level dryness is not generally a defining characteristic of the SAL, but is instead often a signature of subsidence. The results further show that storms generally form on the southern side of the jet, where the background cyclonic vorticity is high. Based upon its depiction in NCEP Global Forecast System meteorological analyses, the jet often helps to form the northern side of the storms and is present to equal extents for both strengthening and weakening storms, suggesting that jet-induced vertical wind shear may not be a frequent negative influence. Warm SAL air is confined to regions north of the jet and generally does not impact the tropical cyclone precipitation south of the jet.Composite analyses of the early stages of tropical cyclones occurring in association with the SAL support the inferences from the individual cases noted above. Furthermore, separate composites for strongly strengthening and for weakening storms show few substantial differences in the SAL characteristics between these two groups, suggesting that the SAL is not a determinant of whether a storm will intensify or weaken in the days after formation. Key differences between these cases are found mainly at upper levels where the flow over strengthening storms allows for an expansive outflow and produces little vertical shear, while for weakening storms, the shear is stronger and the outflow is significantly constrained.},

Here we analyse the evolution of maximum winds and total lightning frequency every 6 h during the entire lifetime of 56 hurricanes around the globe. We find that in all of these hurricanes, lightning frequency and maximum sustained winds are significantly correlated (mean correlation coefficient of 0.82), where the maximum sustained winds and minimum pressures in hurricanes are preceded by increases in lightning activity approximately one day before the peak winds. We suggest that increases in lightning activity in hurricanes are related to enhanced convection that increases the rate of moistening of the lower troposphere, which in turn leads to the intensification of hurricanes(2). As lightning activity can now be monitored continuously in hurricanes at any location around the globe(3), lightning data may contribute to better hurricane forecasts in the future.},

	abstract = {We use a three-dimensional chemical transport model to examine the shortwave radiative effects of clouds on the tropospheric ozone budget. In addition to looking at changes in global concentrations as previous studies have done, we examine changes in ozone chemical production and loss caused by clouds and how these vary in different parts of the troposphere. On a global scale, we find that clouds have a modest effect on ozone chemistry, but on a regional scale their role is much more significant, with the size of the response dependent on the region. The largest averaged changes in chemical budgets (+/- 10-14\%) are found in the marine troposphere, where cloud optical depths are high. We demonstrate that cloud effects are small on average in the middle troposphere because this is a transition region between reduction and enhancement in photolysis rates. We show that increases in boundary layer ozone due to clouds are driven by large-scale changes in downward ozone transport from higher in the troposphere rather than by decreases in in-situ ozone chemical loss rates. Increases in upper tropospheric ozone are caused by higher production rates due to backscattering of radiation and consequent increases in photolysis rates, mainly J(NO2). The global radiative effect of clouds on isoprene, through decreases of OH in the lower troposphere, is stronger than on ozone. Tropospheric isoprene lifetime increases by 7\% when taking clouds into account. We compare the importance of clouds in contributing to uncertainties in the global ozone budget with the role of other radiatively-important factors. The budget is most sensitive to the overhead ozone column, while surface albedo and clouds have smaller effects. However, uncertainty in representing the spatial distribution of clouds may lead to a large sensitivity of the ozone budget components on regional scales.},

	abstract = {Using a three-dimensional cloud ensemble model, a systematic exploration is undertaken of radiative-convective equilibrium states as a function of the structure and magnitude of an imposed background flow with vertical shear. In such simulations, mesoscale organization appears naturally, independent of the particulars of the initial condition. As the magnitude of an imposed low-level shear increases, the convection becomes increasingly organized in lines or arcs, propagating broadly downshear, as predicted by earlier work. When the shear is very strong, the convection tends to organize into lines at an angle to the shear, such that the line-normal component is not far from its theoretical optimal value. Midlevel shear favors shear-parallel lines, but if it occurs in conjunction with sufficiently strong low-level shear, the convection can become very strongly organized into lines or arcs generally orthogonal to the low-level shear. Optimal organization occurs when the depth of the shear layer is comparable to that of the cold pools associated with the convective downdrafts.As the vertical shear is increased, the domain-averaged convective available potential energy (CAPE) at first increases but then decreases at stronger shear values. Associated with these changes, the lower to middle troposphere becomes drier at low shear values and more humid when the shear is strong. This relationship between humidity and CAPE is broadly consistent with recently developed CAPE theories. The authors also confirm previous work that shows that the transport of momentum by the simulated convection, though usually down the gradient of the background flow, is nonlocal in character.Finally, some simulations are performed with an imposed hodograph taken from a tropical cyclone. Convective arcs form with an orientation similar to observed outer spiral bands, but the simulated bands propagate more rapidly than observed, perhaps because of a dry middle troposphere in the simulations.},

	abstract = {The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ( TRMM) satellite measurements from the precipitation radar and TRMM microwave imager have been combined to yield a comprehensive 3-yr database of precipitation features (PFs) throughout the global Tropics ( 6368 latitude). The PFs retrieved using this algorithm ( which number nearly six million Tropicswide) have been sorted by size and intensity ranging from small shallow features greater than 75 km(2) in area to large mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) according to their radar and ice scattering characteristics. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the diurnal cycle of the observed precipitation features' rainfall amount, precipitation feature frequency, rainfall intensity, convective - stratiform rainfall portioning, and remotely sensed convective intensity, sampled Tropicswide from space.The observations are sorted regionally to examine the stark differences in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and convective intensity over land and ocean areas. Over the oceans, the diurnal cycle of rainfall has small amplitude, with the maximum contribution to rainfall coming from MCSs in the early morning. This increased contribution is due to an increased number of MCSs in the nighttime hours, not increasing MCS areas or conditional rain rates, in agreement with previous works. Rainfall from sub-MCS features over the ocean has little appreciable diurnal cycle of rainfall or convective intensity. Land areas have a much larger rainfall cycle than over the ocean, with a marked minimum in the midmorning hours and a maximum in the afternoon, slowly decreasing through midnight. Non-MCS features have a significant peak in afternoon instantaneous conditional rain rates ( the mean rain rate in raining pixels), and convective intensities, which differs from previous studies using rain rates derived from hourly rain gauges. This is attributed to enhancement by afternoon heating. MCSs over land have a convective intensity peak in the late afternoon, however all land regions have MCS rainfall peaks that occur in the late evening through midnight due to their longer life cycle. The diurnal cycle of overland MCS rainfall and convective intensity varies significantly among land regions, attributed to MCS sensitivity to the varying environmental conditions in which they occur.},

A data-screening scheme is developed to attain good quality data in cloud-free conditions, and the polarization measurement is used to separate dust from non-dust aerosol. The CALIPSO aerosol observations are compared with aerosol simulations from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation Transport (GOCART) model and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The CALIPSO observations of geographical patterns and seasonal variations of AOD are generally consistent with GOCART simulations and MODIS retrievals especially near source regions, while the magnitude of AOD shows large discrepancies in most regions. Both the CALIPSO observation and GOCART model show that the aerosol extinction scale heights in major dust and smoke source regions are generally higher than that in industrial pollution source regions. The CALIPSO aerosol lidar ratio also generally agrees with GOCART model within 30\% on regional scales. Major differences between satellite observations and GOCART model are identified, including (1) an underestimate of aerosol extinction by GOCART over the Indian sub-continent, (2) much larger aerosol extinction calculated by GOCART than observed by CALIPSO in dust source regions, (3) much weaker in magnitude and more concentrated aerosol in the lower atmosphere in CALIPSO observation than GOCART model over transported areas in midlatitudes, and (4) consistently lower aerosol scale height by CALIPSO observation than GOCART model. Possible factors contributing to these differences are discussed.},

In the present study it is shown that the observed phenomena listed above can be attributed to the presence of small cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) with diameters less than about 0.05 μm. An increase in vertical velocity above cloud base can lead to an increase in supersaturation and to activation of the smallest CCN, resulting in production of new droplets several kilometers above the cloud base. A significant increase in supersaturation can be also caused by a decrease in droplet concentration during intense warm rain formation accompanied by an intense vertical velocity.

	abstract = {Marine stratocumulus cloud properties, and the free-tropospheric environment above them, are examined in NASA A-Train satellite data for cases where smoke from seasonal burning of the West African savannah overlay the persistent southeast Atlantic stratocumulus cloud deck. CALIPSO space-borne lidar observations show that features identified as layers of aerosol occur predominantly between 2 km and 4 km. Layers identified as cloud features occur predominantly below 1.5 km altitude and beneath the layer of elevated smoke aerosol. The diurnal mean shortwave heating rates attributable to the absorption of solar energy in the aerosol layer is nearly 1.5Kd(-1) for an aerosol optical thickness value of 1, and increases to 1.8Kd(-1) when the smoke resides above clouds owing to the additional component of upward solar radiation reflected by the cloud. As a consequence of this heating, the 700 hPa air temperature above the cloud deck is warmer by approximately 1 K on average for cases where smoke is present above the cloud compared to cases without smoke above cloud. The warmer conditions in the free-troposphere above the cloud during smoke events coincide with cloud liquid water path values that are greater by 20 gm(-2) and cloud tops that are lower for overcast conditions compared to periods with low amounts of smoke. The observed thickening and subsidence of the cloud layer are consistent with published results of large-eddy simulations showing that solar absorption by smoke above stratocumulus clouds increases the buoyancy of free-tropospheric air above the temperature inversion capping the boundary layer. Increased buoyancy inhibits the entrainment of dry air through the cloud-top, thereby helping to preserve humidity and cloud cover in the boundary layer. The direct radiative effect of absorbing aerosols residing over a bright cloud deck is a positive radiative forcing (warming) at the top of the atmosphere. However, the greater liquid water path for cases of smoke overlaying cloud contributes an additional negative semi-direct radiative forcing (cooling) of climate in locations such as the southeast Atlantic Ocean owing to the enhanced albedo of the thicker cloud.},

	abstract = {Subseasonal variability of cloud radiative properties in the persistent southeast Pacific stratocumulus deck is investigated using MODIS satellite observations and NCEP reanalysis data. A once-daily albedo proxy is derived based on the fractional coverage of low cloud (a macrophysical field) and the cloud albedo, with the latter broken down into contributions from microphysics (cloud droplet concentration) and macrophysics (liquid water path). Subseasonal albedo variability is dominated by the contribution of low cloud fraction variability, except within 10-15 degrees of the South American coast, where cloud albedo variability contributes significantly. Covariance between cloud fraction and cloud albedo also contributes significantly and positively to the variance in albedo, which highlights how complex and inseparable the factors controlling albedo are. Droplet concentration variability contributes only weakly to the subseasonal variability of albedo, which emphasizes that attributing albedo variability to the indirect effects of aerosols against the backdrop of natural meteorological variability is extremely challenging.The dominant large scale meteorological variability is associated with the subtropical high pressure system. Two indices representing changes in the subtropical high strength and extent explain 80-90\% of this variability, and significantly modulate the cloud microphysical, macrophysical, and radiative cloud properties. Variations in droplet concentration of up to 50\% of the mean are associated with the meteorological driving. We hypothesize that these fluctuations in droplet concentration are a result of the large scale meteorology and their correlation with cloud macrophysical properties should not be used as evidence of aerosol effects. Mechanisms by which large scale meteorology affects cloud properties are explored. Our results support existing hypotheses linking cloud cover variability to changes in cold advection, subsidence, and lower tropospheric stability. Within 10 degrees of the coast interactions between variability in the surface high pressure system and the orography appear to modulate both cloud macrophysical properties and aerosol transport through suppression of the marine boundary layer depth near the coast. This suggests one possible way in which cloud macrophysical properties and droplet concentration may be correlated independently of the second aerosol indirect effect. The results provide variability constraints for models that strive to represent both meteorological and aerosol impacts on stratocumulus clouds.},

	abstract = {[1] The climatological ozone profile in the tropics is shaped like an "S, ” with a minimum at the surface, a maximum at 330 K (similar to6.5 km), another minimum at 345 K (similar to11.2 km), and a subsequent increase toward the tropopause. These features can be reproduced by a very simple model whose only free parameter is the mean ozone mixing ratio of air detraining from deep convective clouds. To first order, the climatological ozone profile in the tropics arises from a balance between vertical advection, deep convection, and chemistry. The 345 K ozone minimum is coincident with a lapse rate minimum. Both minima are associated with a large increase in convective outflow at 345 K followed by a quasi-exponential decrease. The increase in ozone above 345 K is caused mainly by decreased injection of low-ozone air from the boundary layer. The model tends to underestimate ozone between 340 and 365 K (similar to9-15 km). This is most likely due either to an underestimate by the model of in situ ozone production or to eddy transport of ozone from the lowermost stratosphere into the upper tropical troposphere across the subtropical jet. The magnitudes of both these processes are poorly constrained by measurements. In the case of ozone production this is mainly due to a lack of measurements of HOx precursors such as acetone and CH3OOH between 11 and 16 km.},

Using lognormal distributions fitted to measured aerosol size distributions and measured aerosol chemical compositions, ice nuclei and ice crystal concentrations in the wave cloud were reasonably well predicted in a 1D parcel model framework. Two different empirical parameterizations were used in the parcel model: a parameterization based on aerosol chemical type and surface area and a parameterization that links ice nuclei number concentrations to the number concentrations of particles with diameters larger than 0.5 mu m. This study shows that aerosol size distribution and composition measurements can be used to constrain ice initiation by primary nucleation in models.

	abstract = {Deep convective clouds in the Tropics have long been recognized to occur on a wide spectrum of spatial scales, ranging from the individual cumulus to the meso- and synoptic-scale cloud systems. The objective of this paper is to examine the scale dependence of the properties of clouds embedded in the Intertropical Convergence Zone.The Indian Ocean during the winter and summer monsoons offers an ideal domain to undertake this study, which uses INSAT-1B infrared imagery. The cloud systems are retrieved using the detect and spread algorithm and classified according to their top temperatures. Their spatial extension spans a continuous spectrum of individual clouds ranging from 500 km(2) to 10(6) km(2). The spatial distribution of these convective clouds over the Indian Ocean exhibits an increase in convective activity during boreal winter compared to summer. Despite the drastic modification of the synoptic environment over the seasonal cycle, intrinsic cloud properties in January and July are shown to be very similar.The intrinsic cloud properties that are retrieved are the convective core area relative to the total cloud area. the area colder than 240 K (corresponding roughly to stratiform precipitation), the average cloud-top temperature of the entire cloud (core and anvil), and the minimum cloud-top temperature within a cloud that is assumed to denote the temperature of the overshooting cloud tops.The analysis reveals a critical scale of about 10(4) km(2), which distinguishes two separate convective regimes of scale-dependent cloud properties. Below the critical scale, the cloud mean effective temperature increases with cloud size and the relative core area decreases with the size, The overshooting cloud-top temperature is invariant to the cloud scale. For scales larger than the critical value, the scale dependence is reversed: the mean cloud temperature decreases, the fractional core area increases, and the overshooting cloud top strongly decreases as the cloud size increases. Essentially. the area of undiluted deep convective core increases with the total area of the cloud system, in turn affecting the macroscale properties such as cloud greenhouse effect and tropopause temperature, to name a few. In particular, it is the larger-scale ({\textgreater}10(4) km(2)) organized system that penetrates to the tropopause and determines the tropopause altitude, while the smaller scales ({\textless}10(4) km(2)) hardly reach the upper troposphere. Diurnal variations of the convective cloud cover are also presented with respect to the cloud size. The diurnal cycle of these systems depends significantly on their scale and exhibits complex patterns.A discussion of these cloud statistics is then offered in the context of general circulation model parameterization.},

The aerosol is shown to modulate the predator-prey response. Steady-state solution to the proposed model shows the known existence of bistability in cloudiness. Three regimes are identified in the time-dependent solutions: (i) the weakly precipitating regime where cloud and rain coexist in a quasi steady state; (ii) the moderately drizzling regime where limit-cycle behavior in the cloud and rain fields is produced; and (iii) the heavily precipitating clouds where collapse of the boundary layer is predicted. The manifestation of predator-prey behavior in the aerosol-cloud-precipitation system is a further example of the self-organizing properties of the system and suggests that exploiting principles of population dynamics may help reduce complex aerosol-cloud-rain interactions to a more tractable problem.},

	abstract = {An algorithm is described for generating stochastic three-dimensional (3D) cloud fields from time-height fields derived from vertically pointing radar. This model is designed to generate cloud fields that match the statistics of the input fields as closely as possible. The major assumptions of the algorithm are that the statistics of the fields are translationally invariant in the horizontal and independent of horizontal direction; however, the statistics do depend on height. The algorithm outputs 2D or 3D stochastic fields of liquid water content (LWC) and (optionally) effective radius. The algorithm is a generalization of the Fourier filtering methods often used for stochastic cloud models. The Fourier filtering procedure generates Gaussian stochastic fields from a "Gaussian" cross-correlation matrix, which is a function of a pair of heights and the horizontal distance (or "lag"). The Gaussian fields are nonlinearly transformed to give the correct LWC histogram for each height. The "Gaussian" cross-correlation matrix is specially chosen so that, after the nonlinear transformation, the cross-correlation matrix of the cloud mask fields approximately matches that derived from the input LWC fields. The cloud mask correlation function is chosen because the clear/ cloud boundaries are thought to be important for 3D radiative transfer effects in cumulus.The stochastic cloud generation algorithm is tested with 3 months of boundary layer cumulus cloud data from an 8.6-mm wavelength radar on the island of Nauru. Winds from a 915-MHz wind profiler are used to convert the radar fields from time to horizontal distance. Tests are performed comparing the statistics of 744 radar-derived input fields to the statistics of 100 2D and 3D stochastic output fields. The single-point statistics as a function of height agree nearly perfectly. The input and stochastic cloud mask cross-correlation matrices agree fairly well. The cloud fractions agree to within 0.005 (the total cloud fraction is 18\%). The cumulative distributions of optical depth, cloud thickness, cloud width, and intercloud gap length agree reasonably well. In the future, this stochastic cloud field generation algorithm will be used to study domain-averaged 3D radiative transfer effects in cumulus clouds. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The correlations between rain rates and TMI 85-GHz brightness temperatures (Tb) for convective and stratiform rain are generated using 7 years of collocated TMI and TRMM precipitation radar (PR) data. The TMI algorithm for estimating the convective ratio of rainfall is also modified. This paper highlights both the improvements in the v7 algorithm and the continuing problems with the land rainfall retrievals. It is demonstrated that the proposed changes to the algorithm significantly lower the overestimation by TMI globally and over large sections of central Africa and South America. Also highlighted are the problems with the 2A12 land algorithm that have not been addressed in the version 7 algorithm, such as large regional and seasonal dependence of biases in the TMI rain estimates, and potential changes to the algorithm to resolve these problems are discussed.},

This can result in time lags of the diurnal cycle of deep convective clouds detected from infrared satellite measurements with different brightness temperature thresholds because different amounts of cirrus clouds contaminate the measurement. The diurnal cycles of rain from the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) radar during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere (LBA) Experiment in Amazonia and the diurnal cycles of deep convective clouds and high cold clouds from the Precipitation Radar (PR), Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) onboard the TRMM satellite over the tropics (30 degrees S-30 degrees N) from November 1998 to April 1999 are investigated to study the influence of cirrus clouds on the observed diurnal cycle of tropical deep convective clouds. A 2-hour time lag of the diurnal cycle of deep convective clouds from the VIRS with respect to that from the PR is found over land. Over ocean the cirrus clouds generated by deep convective clouds enhance the diurnal cycle of the deep convective clouds from the VIRS, and a time lag similar to that over land also occurs. The influence of cirrus clouds leads the diurnal cycle of the deep convective clouds from the VIRS to depend strongly on the selected IR threshold and to be very different from that of the PR over the maritime continent. Moreover, over ocean and the maritime continent, from late afternoon to midnight the strong increase of the deep convective clouds from the VIRS is mainly due to the developing cirrus clouds near and above the tropical tropopause layer.},

Regional patterns of tropical clouds emerge from the data, matching expectations from existing observations. The advantage of the lidar is highlighted by the distribution of cloud-top height, revealing the preponderance of low-level clouds over the tropical oceans. Over land, cloud top is more uniformly distributed under the influence of diurnal variation. The integrated cloud-top distribution suggests tropical, marine low-cloud amount around 25-30\%; a merged CALIPSO-CloudSat product has a similar cloud-top distribution and includes a complementary estimate of cloud fraction based on the lidar detections. The low-cloud distribution is similar to that found in fields of shallow cumulus observed during the Rain in Cumulus Over the Ocean (RICO) field study. The similarity is enhanced by sampling near the RICO site or sampling large-scale conditions similar to those during RICO.

The focus here is on tropical, low-level clouds, which have been identified as important for estimates of climate sensitivity. Investigating the distribution of the monthly mean vertical velocity and lower-tropospheric stability, the aquaplanets are seen to capture the core of the distribution of the more Earth-like configurations, whose distributions are, in turn, similar to that of reanalysis data. By conditionally sampling over these distributions, low-cloud regimes are defined, separating shallow cumulus convection from stratocumulus. Within each regime, the GCMs produce similar large-scale environments, yet disparate depictions of the clouds. Aquaplanets lack stratocumulus because of their zonally symmetric boundary conditions, but produce extensive trade-wind regions populated by shallow cumulus clouds just like those in the Earth-like setting. The analysis shows that aquaplanets can be compared with observations, just as well as the Earth-like configuration, with the added ability to focus on particular regimes without complications from geographical or temporal biases.},

Ensemble-simulations were carried out with the GCM to assess the aerosol direct and indirect effects, hereafter ADE and AIE. Each simulation was started from the NCEP-analyzed initial conditions for 1 May and was integrated through May-June-July-August of each year: 1982-1987 to provide an ensemble set of six simulations. In the first set, called experiment (\#1), climatological aerosols were prescribed. The next two experiments (\#2 and \#3) had two sets of simulations each: one with 2X and other with 1/2X the climatological aerosols over each of the four selected regions. In experiment \#2, the anomaly regions were advectively restricted (AR), i.e., the large-scale prognostic fields outside the aerosol anomaly regions were prescribed while in experiment \#3, the anomaly regions were advectively Interactive (AI) as is the case in a normal GCM integrations, but with the same aerosols anomalies as in experiment \#2. Intercomparisons of circulation, diabatic heating, and precipitation difference fields showed large disparities among the AR and AI simulations, which raised serious questions about the proverbial AR assumption, commonly invoked in regional climate simulation studies. Consequently AI simulation mode was chosen for the subsequent studies. Two more experiments (\#4 and \#5) were performed in the AI mode in which ADE and AIE were activated one at a time. The results showed that ADE and AIE work in concert to make the joint influences larger than sum of each acting alone. Moreover, the ADE and AIE influences were vastly different for the Indian and Africa regions, which suggest an imperative need to include them rationally in climate models. We also found that the aerosol induced increase of tropical cirrus clouds would potentially offset any cirrus thinning that may occur due to warming in response to CO2 increase.},

The radar echo evolution follows fairly closely the Marshall-Palmer distribution with scatter toward higher values of Z(dr) especially in the earliest stages of echo intensification, where some of the scatter in the whole-sweep values is caused by size sorting. The data provide no evidence for an important role of ultragiant aerosols (UGA) in initiating coalescence.

The data suggest that in unpolluted trade wind cumuli: (1) the production of large cloud droplets near cloud base is controlled primarily by the intensity of the cloud base updraft rather than the concentration of giant/ultragiant sea-salt particles; (2) higher droplet concentrations are more likely under conditions of stronger low-level wind speeds, primarily because stronger low-level wind speeds are associated with more intense cloud base updrafts.},

The analyses indicate that on average, precipitation rates greater than 0.1 mm h(-1) occur over about 11\% of the area occupied by trade wind clouds at any given time, while about 1.5\% of the cloudy areas had rainfall rates which exceeded 1.0 mm h(-1).

In this model overshooting convective turrets inject dehydrated tropospheric air into a tropical "tropopause layer” (TTL) bounded approximately by the 50- and 150-hPa surfaces, a layer similar to the "entrainment zone” at the top of the planetary boundary layer. The overshooting process occurs only in limited regions. In the TTL, mixtures of overshooting and ambient air undergo buoyancy-driven settling, then slowly loft through the TTL and eventually enter the main stratosphere throughout the Tropics. It is found that for reasonable parameter settings the combined action of convection, isentropic mixing, and advection by the large-scale circulation in the model can produce realistic water vapor and ozone profiles while balancing the energy budget. Some of the observed peculiarities that can be simulated are (i) the widespread absence of vapor saturation at the tropopause despite tropical mean upward motion, (ii) an ozone minimum below the mean tropopause, and (iii) the typical location of stratiform cloud tops below the mean tropopause. In contrast to inferences from typical "cold trap” models, the relative humidity of air crossing the tropopause is found to be sensitive to ice microphysics.},

	abstract = {A simple numerical model designed to predict the evolution of cloud droplet spectra with special emphasis on the role of entrainment is developed for a case of nonprecipitating cloud. The model assumes that the cloud water mixing ratio at any grid location is equal to that predicted by a cloud model using bulk microphysics; that is, supersaturation/undersaturation inside cloud is neglected. Locally, only undiluted droplet concentrations are assumed to exist; any average dilution of cloud droplet concentration observed over a grid volume is in as an effect of internal structure within the grid, with undiluted cloudy patches coexisting with those that are cloud free. Activation of cloud condensation nuclei is assumed to always produce the same initial spectrum of cloud droplets. Further condensational growth of this initial spectrum produces a set of base functions that are used to represent droplet spectral evolution.The microphysical model, combined with the two-dimensional cloud model using bulk microphysics, is applied to an idealized case of small cumulus. It is shown that, within the current framework, entrainment usually leads to fresh activation of cloud droplets and results in multimodal spectra in actively growing cells. Both broad and narrow cloud droplet spectra are predicted in old, highly diluted cells at cloud periphery. These results are discussed in the context of both observational and theoretical studies of droplet spectral evolution.},

The field intensive phase of VOCALS-REx took place during October and November 2008 and constitutes a critical part of a broader CLIVAR program (VOCALS) designed to develop and promote scientific activities leading to improved understanding, model simulations, and predictions of the southeastern Pacific (SEP) coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system, on diurnal to interannual timescales. The other major components of VOCALS are a modeling program with a model hierarchy ranging from the local to global scales, and a suite of extended observations from regular research cruises, instrumented moorings, and satellites. The two central themes of VOCALS-REx focus upon (a) links between aerosols, clouds and precipitation and their impacts on marine stratocumulus radiative properties, and (b) physical and chemical couplings between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere, including the role that mesoscale ocean eddies play. A set of hypotheses designed to be tested with the combined field, monitoring and modeling work in VOCALS is presented here. A further goal of VOCALS-REx is to provide datasets for the evaluation and improvement of large-scale numerical models.

	abstract = {Subtropical shallow cumulus convection is shown to play an important role in tropical climate dynamics, in which convective mixing between the atmospheric boundary layer and the free troposphere initiates a chain of large-scale feedbacks. It is found that the presence of shallow convection in the subtropics helps set the width and intensity of oceanic ITCZs, a mechanism here termed the shallow cumulus humidity throttle because of the control exerted on the moisture supply to the deep convection zones. These conclusions are reached after investigations based on a tropical climate model of intermediate complexity, with sufficient vertical degrees of freedom to capture (i) the effects of shallow convection on the boundary layer moisture budget and (ii) the dependency of deep convection on the free-tropospheric humidity. An explicit shallow cumulus mixing time scale in this simple parameterization is varied to assess sensitivity, with moist static energy budget analysis aiding to identify how the local effect of shallow convection is balanced globally. A reduction in the mixing efficiency of shallow convection leads to a more humid atmospheric mixed layer, and less surface evaporation, with a drier free troposphere outside of the convecting zones. Advection of drier free-tropospheric air from the subtropics by transients such as dry intrusions, as well as by mean inflow, causes a substantial narrowing of the convection zones by inhibition of deep convection at their margins. In the tropical mean, the reduction of convection by this narrowing more than compensates for the reduction in surface evaporation. Balance is established via a substantial decrease in tropospheric temperatures throughout the Tropics, associated with the reduction in convective heating. The temperature response-and associated radiative contribution to the net flux into the column-have broad spatial scales, while the reduction of surface evaporation is concentrated outside of the convecting zones. This results in differential net flux across the convecting zone, in a sense that acts to destabilize those areas that do convect. This results in stronger large-scale convergence and more intense convection within a narrower area. Finally, mixed layer ocean experiments show that in a coupled ocean-atmosphere system this indirect feedback mechanism can lead to SST differences up to +2 K between cases with different shallow cumulus mixing time, tending to counteract the direct radiative impact of low subtropical clouds on SST.},

Indeed, much of modern meteorology has grown out of the study of these weather systems, aided by the development of conceptual models of cyclone structure and evolution. Early versions of these models derived from a combination of physical understanding and collections of observations, and today, results from numerical models are used to augment this process. Though observations have played a key role in understanding extratropical cyclone evolution, global observations of the internal structure of the clouds that accompany these storms have been lacking. The launch of Cloudsat in 2006 introduced a new tool for observing the details of clouds and precipitation produced by midlatitude weather systems. In this paper, we examine recent measurements of frontal clouds and precipitation from Cloudsat, and reflect back on the early view of these systems as represented in the Norwegian Cyclone Model.

The behavior of islands as miniature continents with variable area supports the traditional thermal hypothesis over the aerosol hypothesis for lightning control, The substantial land-ocean contrast in updraft strength is supported globally by TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) radar comparisons of mixed phase radar reflectivity. The land-ocean updraft contrast is grossly inconsistent with the land-ocean contrast in CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy), from the standpoint of parcel theory. This inconsistency is resolved by the scaling of buoyant parcel size with cloud base height, as suggested by earlier investigators. Strongly electrified continental convection is then favored by a larger surface Bowen ratio, and by larger, more strongly buoyant boundary layer parcels which more efficiently transform CAPE to kinetic energy of the updraft in the moist stage of conditional instability.},

A simulation of this cloud from the Met Office cloud-resolving model (CRM) has been utilized in these tests. This cumulus cloud was observed h aircraft during the initial stage of its growth over New Mexico on 10 August 1987. The growth of the simulated cloud is divided into two parts: a shallow phase followed by a deep phase. Maximum values of the cloud depth in these two phases were 5 and 9 km. respectively.In the EMM simulations including only the shallow phase, the precipitation efficiency was found to decrease substantially with increasing atmospheric concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Also, the graupel mixing ratio and total ice concentration ere found to decrease as normalized CCN concentration are increased above typical continental values. These changes are explicable in terms of: (I) the Hallett-Mossop (H-M) process at -3 to -8 degreesC and the freezing of supercooled raindrops in collisions with ice splinters dominating the glaciation and (2) the warm-rain process being more significant for the overall precipitation production than the ice process in these particular Simulations. The almost complete suppression of precipitation by extreme CCN concentrations corresponding to a forest-fire plume in the EMM simulation is consistent with the analysis by Rosenfeld of satellite images of Indonesian cumuli engulfed by smoke from biomass burning.A clear tendency for ice crystals to be smaller and more numerous in the anvil as found with increasing CCN concentrations beyond typical continental values in long-term simulations that included the deep phase. The sensitivity of the precipitation rate to the normalized CCN concentration was found to be relatively low in these deep cases.},

	abstract = {Cloud development, the onset of precipitation and the effect of aerosol on clouds depend on the structure of the cloud profiles of droplet size and phase. Aircraft measurements of cloud profiles are limited in their temporal and spatial extent. Satellites were used to observe cloud tops not cloud profiles with vertical profiles of precipitation-sized droplets anticipated from CloudSat. The recently proposed CLAIM-3D satellite mission (cloud aerosol interaction mission in 3-D) suggests to measure profiles of cloud microphysical properties by retrieving them from the solar and infrared radiation reflected or emitted from cloud sides. Inversion of measurements from the cloud sides requires rigorous understanding of the 3-dimensional (3-D) properties of clouds. Here we discuss the reflected sunlight from the cloud sides and top at two wavelengths: one nonabsorbing to solar radiation (0.67 mu m) and one with liquid water efficient absorption of solar radiation (2.1 mu m). In contrast to the plane-parallel approximation, a conventional approach to all current operational retrievals, 3-D radiative transfer is used for interpreting the observed reflectances. General properties of the radiation reflected from the sides of an isolated cloud are discussed. As a proof of concept, the paper shows a few examples of radiation reflected from cloud fields generated by a simple stochastic cloud model with the prescribed vertically resolved microphysics. To retrieve the information about droplet sizes, we propose to use the probability density function of the droplet size distribution and its first two moments instead of the assumption about fixed values of the droplet effective radius. The retrieval algorithm is based on the Bayesian theorem that combines prior information about cloud structure and microphysics with radiative transfer calculations.},

	abstract = {We use ozonesondes launched from Samoa (14 degrees S) during the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) Tropics A to show that O-3 mixing ratios usually start increasing toward stratospheric values near 14 km. This is well below the tropical tropopause las defined either in terms of lapse rate or cold point), which usually occurs between 16 and 17 km. We argue that the main reason for this discrepancy in height between the chemopause and tropopause is that there is very little convective detrainment of ozone-depleted marine boundary layer air above 14 km. We conjecture that the top of the Hadley circulation occurs at roughly 14 km, that convective penetration above this altitude is rare, and that air that is injected above this height subsequently participates in a slow vertical ascent into the stratosphere. The observed dependence of ozone on potential temperature in the transitional zone between the 14-km chemopause and the tropical tropopause is consistent with what would be expected from this hypothesis given calculated clear-sky heating rates and typical in situ ozone production rates in this region. An observed anticorrelation between ozone and equivalent potential temperature below 14 km is consistent with what would be expected from an overturning Hadley circulation, with some transport of high O-3/low theta(e) air from midlatitudes. We also argue that the positive correlations between O-3 and N2O in the transitional zone obtained during the 1994 Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment/Measurements for Assessing the Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft) (ASHOE/MAESA) campaign support the notion that air in this region does have trace elements of Stratospheric air las conjectured previously), so that some of the ozone in the transitional zone does originate from the stratosphere rather than being entirely produced in situ.},

	abstract = {This study utilizes the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite precipitation radar (PR), lightning imaging sensor (LIS), and passive microwave imager (TMI) data together with ground-based lightning data to investigate the vertical structure, lightning, and rainfall characteristics of Amazonian and subtropical South American convection for three separate wet seasons. These characteristics are partitioned as a function of 850-mb zonal wind direction, motivated by observations collected during the 6-week TRMM-Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) field campaign. The TRMM-LBA field campaign observations suggest that systematic variations in Amazonian convective vertical structure, lightning, and rainfall are all linked to bimodal variations in the low-level zonal wind (e. g., easterly and westerly regimes). The more spatially and temporally comprehensive TRMM dataset used in this study extends the TRMM-LBA observations by examining regime variability in Amazonian and South American convective structure over a continental-scale domain.On a continental scale, patterns of east and west regime 850-700-mb winds combined with LIS lightning flash densities suggest the presence of synoptic-scale controls [e. g., intrusion of extratropical frontal systems and interaction with the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ)] on regional-scale variability in convective vertical structure. TRMM PR, TMI, and ground-based lightning data suggest that regional variability in wet-season convective structure is most evident over the southern Amazon, Mato Grosso, Altiplano, southern Brazil, and eastern coastal regions of central and southern South America. Convective vertical structure, convective rainfall rates, and lightning activity are all more pronounced during easterly (westerly) regimes over the southern Amazon and Mato Grosso (Altiplano, and southern Brazil). Importantly, when considered with case study results from TRMM-LBA, the systematic differences in convective structure that occur as a function of regime suggest that associated regime differences may exist in the vertical distribution of diabatic heating. Hence the discrimination of convective vertical structure "regimes” over parts of the Amazon and vicinity based on a resolved variable such as the 850-700-mb zonal wind direction, while far from being perfect, may have important applications to the problems of cumulus parameterization, rainfall estimation, and retrievals of latent heating over the Amazon.},

Echo fractions on the scale of the radar domain range between 0\% and 10\% and vary greatly within a period from a few hours to a day. Variability in precipitation relates most strongly to variability in humidity and the zonal wind speed, although greater inversion heights and deeper clouds are also evident at times of more rain.

Total, stratospheric, and tropospheric column ozone amounts usually peak between August and November. Other features are a persistent zonal wave-one pattern in total column ozone and signatures of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in stratospheric ozone. The wave-one is due to a greater concentration of free tropospheric ozone over the tropical Atlantic than the Pacific and appears to be associated with tropical general circulation and seasonal pollution from biomass burning. Tropospheric ozone over the Indian and Pacific Oceans displays influences of the waning 1997-1998 El Nino, seasonal convection, and pollution transport from Africa. The most distinctive feature of SHADOZ tropospheric ozone is variability in the data, e. g., a factor of 3 in column amount at 8 of 10 stations. Seasonal and monthly means may not be robust quantities because statistics are frequently not Gaussian even at sites that are always in tropical air. Models and satellite retrievals should be evaluated on their capability for reproducing tropospheric variability and fine structure. A 1999 2000 ozone record from Paramaribo, Surinam (6degreesN, 55degreesW) (also in SHADOZ) shows a marked contrast to southern tropical ozone because Surinam is often north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). A more representative tropospheric ozone climatology for models and satellite retrievals requires additional Northern Hemisphere tropical data.},

	abstract = {Tropical cirrus evolution and its relation to upper-tropospheric water vapor (UTWV) are examined in the paper by analyzing satellite-derived cloud data, UTWV data from infrared and microwave measurements, and the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis wind field. Building upon the existing International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data and the Television and Infrared Observation Satellite ( TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) product, a global ( except polar region), 6-hourly cirrus dataset is developed from two infrared radiance measurements at 11 and 12 m m. The UTWV is obtained in both clear and cloudy locations by developing a combined satellite infrared and microwave-based retrieval. The analysis in this study is conducted in a Lagrangian framework. The Lagrangian trajectory analysis shows that the decay of deep convection is immediately followed by the growth of cirrostratus and cirrus, and then the decay of cirrostratus is followed by the continued growth of cirrus. Cirrus properties continuously evolve along the trajectories as they gradually thin out and move to the lower levels. Typical tropical cirrus systems last for 19-30 +/- 16 h. This is much longer than cirrus particle lifetimes, suggesting that other processes (e.g., large-scale lifting) replenish the particles to maintain tropical cirrus. Consequently, tropical cirrus can advect over large distances, about 600-1000 km, during their lifetimes. For almost all current GCMs, this distance spans more than one grid box, requiring that the water vapor and cloud water budgets include an advection term. Based on their relationship to convective systems, detrainment cirrus are distinguished from in situ cirrus. It is found that more than half of the tropical cirrus are formed in situ well away from convection. The interaction between cirrus and UTWV is explored by comparing the evolution of the UTWV along composite clear trajectories and trajectories with cirrus. Cirrus are found to be associated with a moister upper troposphere and a slower rate of decrease of UTWV. Moreover, the elevated UTWV has a longer duration than cirrus. The amount of water in cirrus is too small for evaporation of cirrus ice particles to moisten the upper troposphere significantly (but cirrus may be an important water vapor sink). Rather, it is likely that the same transient motions that produce the cirrus also transport water vapor upward to maintain a larger UTWV.},

The results show that the simulated NOx in the tropical middle and upper troposphere are very sensitive to the amount and altitude of the lightning NOx used in the model. A global lightning NOx production of 7 Tg N yr(-1) uniformly distributed in convective clouds or 3.5 Tg N yr(-1) distributed in the upper cloud regions produces good agreement between calculated and measured NOx concentrations in the tropics.},

	abstract = {Vertical motions in clouds arise from a variety of thermodynamic processes, including latent heat release, evaporative cooling, melting, and cloud radiative heating. In the Tropics, the net upward vertical mass flux from convective systems should approximately balance subsidence in clear sky regions associated with radiative cooling, provided the exchange of mass with midlatitudes can be assumed small. Tropical climatologies of temperature, water vapor, and ozone are used to calculate the clear sky radiative mass flux, and the derivative of this mass flux with respect to potential temperature, dM(r)(theta)/dtheta, is used as a proxy for net convective outflow. Convective outflow increases rapidly at 345 K (similar to11.3 km). This corresponds to the pseudoequivalent potential temperature theta(e) at which air parcels near the surface first attain positive convective available potential energy (CAPE). The rate at which dM(r)(theta)/dtheta decreases above 345 K is similar to the rate at which the near surface theta(e) probability distribution function (PDF) decreases. This behavior is referred to as "scaling.” It suggests that the timescale for removal of an air parcel from the convective boundary layer is independent of theta(e) (once it has positive CAPE), and that the residual vertical mass flux from convective clouds can be described as if air parcels detrain near their level of neutral buoyancy (LNB). It is also suggested that the mean tropical temperature profile above 345 K is controlled, not by mixing, but by the need for the vertical variation in net convective outflow to be consistent with the near-surface theta(e) PDF, and that this accounts for the fact that the mean temperature profile above 345 K increasingly deviates from a moist adiabat. It is also argued that there are sufficient high theta(e) air parcels near the surface to sustain the Brewer-Dobson circulation by detrainment at the LNB followed by radiative ascent into the stratosphere.},

False alarm rate due to instrument noise yields similar to5 false triggers per month for LIS, and is negligible for OTD. Flash detection efficiency, based on prior optical pulse sensor measurements, is predicted to be 93 +/- 4\% and 73 +/- 11\% for LIS night and noon; 56 +/- 7\% and 44 +/- 9\% for OTD night and noon, corresponding to a 12\%-20\% diurnal variability and LIS: OTD ratio of 1.7. Use of the weighted daily mean detection efficiency (i.e., not controlling for local hour) corresponds to sigma = 8\%-9\% uncertainty. These are likely overestimates of actual flash detection efficiency due to differences in pixel ground field of view across the instrument arrays that are not accounted for in the validation optical pulse sensor data.},

Cloud and radiation budget quantities in the tropics show well-defined responses to the large-scale vertical motion at 500 hPa. For the tropics as a whole, the ratio of shortwave to longwave cloud forcing (hereafter N) is about 1.2 in regions of upward motion, and increases to about 1.9 in regions of strong subsidence. If the analysis is restricted to oceanic regions with SST {\textgreater} 28 degrees C, N does not increase as much for subsiding motions, because the strato-cumulus regions are eliminated, and the net cloud forcing decreases linearly from about near zero for zero vertical velocity to about -15 Wm(-2) for strongly subsiding motion. Increasingly negative cloud forcing with increasing upward motion is mostly related to an increasing abundance of high, thick clouds.Although a consistent dynamical effect on the annual cycle of about 1 W m(-2) can be identified, the effect of the probability density function (PDF) of the large-scale vertical velocity on long-term trends in the tropical mean radiation budget is very small compared to the observed variations. Observed tropical mean changes can be as large as +/- 3 W m(-2), while the dynamical components are generally smaller than +/- 0.5 W m(-2).For relatively small regions in the east and west Pacific, changes in the relative magnitude of longwave and shortwave cloud forcing can be related to the PDF of vertical velocity. The east Pacific in 1987 and 1998 showed large reductions of N in association with an increase in the fraction of the area in the domain with upward motion, and concomitant increases in high cloud. For the west Pacific in 1998, a large increase in N was caused not so much by a change in the mean vertical motion, but rather by a shift from top-to bottom-heavy upward motion.},

GOES-8 cloud top heights are consistently similar to1 km lower than the "visible” cloud top estimates from the lidar, even though the latter take into account the finite visible opacity of the clouds and any overlying thin cirrus layers, and are often far below the position of highest detected cloud. The low bias in thermal estimates appears to get worse for the tallest clouds, perhaps by an additional kilometer, and depends little on cloud albedo. The consistency of the bias over multiple satellites suggests that cloud retrievals are affected by an unexpected radiative transfer issue.},

We simulated a 15 year period (1979-1993) on the basis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts meteorological reanalyses and a time-varying emission data set. We calculate that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) strongly contributes to O-3 in regions where the photochemistry is quiescent. Since such regions play a minor role in radiative and chemical processes, we argue that STE-derived O-3 is much less important than is suggested by its column abundance. By distinguishing between photochemical pathways in the model we calculate that tropospheric O-3 in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere is strongly affected by industrial and fossil fuel-related emissions. In the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, natural emissions still play a major role. Our model results indicate a less important role for man-made biomass burning emissions than previous analyses. Further, the results show that tropospheric O-3 trends are strongly influenced by transports of pollution and by meteorological variability. Scenario calculations for the year 2025 suggest that man-made emissions at low northern latitudes, in particular in southern and eastern Asia, will become a very strong tropospheric O-3 source in the next decades. This will influence O-3 levels on a hemispheric scale so that despite pollution regulations in Europe and North America, surface O-3 will continue to grow.},

These effects of aerosols on the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud properties and precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes and forms, ranging from desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary strongly over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition therefore requires continuous observations from satellites, networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments. Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven by industrialization and an expanding population, may adversely affect the Earth's climate and water supply.},

	abstract = {[1] We use satellite sensor measurements to obtain a broad picture of the processes affecting tropical tropospheric O-3 production over Africa and the Atlantic in the early part of the year. Terra/MOPITT CO retrievals correlate well with biomass burning fire counts observed by the TRMM/VIRS instrument in Northern Hemisphere savanna regions and allow investigation of the subsequent convection of the biomass burning plume at the intertropical convergence zone and interhemispheric transport. Measurements of NO2 from the ERS-2/GOME instrument enable identification of two important tropical sources of this O-3 precursor, biomass burning and lightning. Good correlation is seen between NO2 retrievals and TRMM/LIS lightning flash observations in southern African regions free of biomass burning, thus indicating a probable lightning source of NOx. The combination of MOPITT CO, GOME NO2, and TRMM fire and lightning flash counts provides a powerful tool for investigating the tropospheric production of O-3 precursors. These data are used in conjunction with the MOZART-2 chemical transport model to investigate the early year tropical Atlantic tropospheric O-3 distribution using January 2001 as a case study. Inconsistencies between the various tropical tropospheric O-3 column products obtained from EP/TOMS data, and between these products, in situ measurements, and modeling, have led to questions about how the Northern Hemisphere biomass burning is connected to the TOMS derived O-3 maximum in the tropical southern Atlantic. We show that the early year tropical O-3 distribution is actually characterized by two maxima. The first arises due to biomass burning emissions, is located near the Northern Hemisphere fires, and is most evident in the lower troposphere. The second is located in the southern tropical Atlantic midtroposphere, and results from NOx produced by lightning over southern Africa and South America.},

In this study a new diagnostic cirrus parameterization scheme is developed with the intention of improving the simulation of cirrus macro- and microphysical properties in large-scale models.The scheme allows both large-scale motions and convective detrainment to be a source of moisture for cirrus. Water vapor depletion is calculated as diffusional growth of ice crystals with known size distributions, and the effective fallout from a model layer is estimated using mass-weighted fall velocities of the bulk precipitation.The scheme was implemented and tested with the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3). The seasonal means of cirrus cloud cover and ice water contents over the warm pool region, as simulated with the new cirrus parameterization, appeared to be much more realistic than in the standard model version when compared to satellite and in situ data. In contrast to the high amount of optically thin cirrus at all cirrus levels simulated by the standard CCM3, cirrus formed with the new scheme are significantly thicker with a reduced amount in the lower part of the upper troposphere (approximately 10-14 km), whereas cirrus formed below the tropopause (approximately 14-17 km) stay thin but have higher cover. It has also been found that a more realistic precipitation treatment not only results in the formation of thicker anvil cirrus, but also increases the rain and evaporation rates in the middle troposphere. These results suggest that cirrus clouds can be an important potential water vapor source in the tropical troposphere.},

The purpose of this review is twofold: first, to describe a number of simple model systems where the coarse-grained or macroscopic behaviour of a system can be explicitly determined from the full, or microscopic, description; and second, to overview some of the emerging algorithmic approaches that have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, macroscopic dynamics.The model problems we describe may be either stochastic or deterministic in both their microscopic and macroscopic behaviour, leading to four possibilities in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions. Model problems are given which illustrate all four situations, and mathematical tools for their study are introduced. These model problems are useful in the evaluation of algorithms. We use specific instances of the model problems to illustrate these algorithms. As the subject of algorithm development and analysis is, in many cases, in its infancy, the primary purpose here is to attempt to unify some of the emerging ideas so that individuals new to the field have a structured access to the literature. Furthermore, by discussing the algorithms in the context of the model problems, a platform for understanding existing algorithms and developing new ones is built.},

	abstract = {Geostationary and Sun-synchronous satellite data and in situ observations from ship cruises are used to investigate the formation of open cellular structure in marine stratocumulus clouds over the southeast Pacific (SEP). Open cellular convection either forms spontaneously as pockets of open cells (POCs) within overcast stratocumulus, or is advected into the region from midlatitude regions. POC formation occurs most frequently during the latter part of the night, demonstrating that this transition is not caused by solar absorption-driven decoupling. The transition preferentially occurs in clouds with low 11-3.9 mu m nighttime brightness temperature difference (BTD) which is found to be well correlated with both in situ measured accumulation mode aerosol concentration and cloud droplet concentration estimates derived from MODIS. Besides indicating that nighttime BTD is an excellent proxy for stratocumulus cloud droplet concentration N-d, this also suggests that low aerosol concentrations favor POC formation. Indeed, extremely low accumulation mode aerosol concentrations are found during the passage of open cell events over the ship. Free-tropospheric moisture is not found to be an important factor in POC formation. Significant subseasonal variability occurs in the fractional coverage of open cellular convection over the broader SEP. This coverage is well correlated with a MODIS-derived drizzle proxy (MDP) proportional to the ratio of liquid water path (LWP) to N-d for predominantly overcast regions. Both LWP and N-d variability influences the MDP. Periods of low MDP have significant positive large-scale N-d anomalies and are preceded by offshore winds at 850 hPa, which suggests a potential continental influence upon open cell formation over the SEP. Together, the results suggest important two-way interactions between aerosols and drizzle in marine stratocumulus and a role for drizzle in modulating the large-scale albedo of these cloud systems.},

This analysis shows that individual convective cloud elements can have strongly positive or negative effects on the radiation balance. Nonetheless, the ensemble of cloud types that occurs in association with deep convection in the Tropics arranges itself so that the individual positive and negative contributions cancel each other when averaged over the convective cloud system. This behavior of the cloud ensemble is extremely interesting, and the authors speculate that it is indicative of feedbacks in the climate system that have not been explored adequately. A simple model is introduced that includes feedbacks that drive the net radiation in convective regions toward the net radiation in adjacent nonconvective areas. If the nonconvective regions have small cloud forcing, then this model predicts small net radiative forcing by the convective cloud ensemble. This feedback process requires that the circulations in the Tropics be sensitive to small SST gradients and that the convective cloud albedo be sensitive to the vertical motion.},

Understanding how precipitation forms within these clouds is necessary to advance our knowledge concerning their role in climate. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the characteristic heights and times at which precipitation in trade wind clouds passes through distinct stages in its evolution as defined by the equivalent radar reflectivity factor at horizontal polarization Z(H), the differential reflectivity Z(DR), and the spatial correlation between and averages of these variables. The data were obtained during the Rain in Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) field campaign by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) S-band dual-polarization (S-Pol) Doppler radar, the National Science Foundation (NSF)-CAR C130 aircraft, and soundings launched near the radar. The data consisted of 76 trade cumuli that were tracked from early echo development through rainout on six days during RICO. Trade wind clouds used in the statistical analyses were segregated based on giant condensation nuclei (GCN) measurements made during low-level aircraft flight legs on the six days.This study found that the rate of precipitation formation in shallow marine cumulus was unrelated to the GCN concentration in the ambient environment. Instead, the rate at which precipitation developed in the clouds appeared to be related to the mesoscale forcing as suggested by the cloud organization. Although GCN had no influence on the rate of precipitation development, the data suggest that they do contribute to a modification of the rain drop size distribution within the clouds. With very few exceptions, high threshold values of Z(DR) were found well above cloud base on days with high GCN concentrations. On the days that were exceptions, these threshold values were almost always achieved near cloud base.},

Typically, MSC is 1 to 2 km deep, has a horizontal length scale of a few to a few tens of kilometers, and takes distinctive planforms: linear and hexagonal. The former is called a cloud street, roll, or band, while the latter is called mesoscale cellular convection (MCC), comprising three-dimensional cells. MSC is characterized by its shape, horizontal extent, convective depth, and aspect ratio. The latter is the ratio of the horizontal extent to that in the vertical. For cells the horizontal extent is their diameter, whereas for rolls it is their spacing. Rolls usually align along or at angles of up to 10 degrees from the mean horizontal wind of the convective layer, with lengths from 20 to 200 km, widths from 2 to 10 km, and convective depths from 2 to 3 km. The typical value of aspect ratio ranges from 2 to 20. Rolls may occur over both water surface and land surfaces. Mesoscale convective cells may be divided into two types: open and closed. Open-cell circulation has downward motion and clear sky in the cell center, surrounded by cloud associated with upward motion. Closed cells have the opposite circulation. Both types of cell have diameters ranging from 10 to 40 km and aspect ratios of 5 to 50, and both occur in a convective layer with a depth of about 1 to 3 km. Both the magnitude and direction of horizontal wind in the convective layer change little with height. MSC results from a complex and incompletely understood mix of processes. These processes are outlined, and their interplay is examined through a review of theoretical and laboratory analyses and numerical modeling of MSG.},

	abstract = {[ 1] In this study, we have performed a set of simulations to detail the evolution of tropospheric ozone from 1890 to 1990. The simulations are compared with available measurements for present-day conditions and earlier. Using our best estimates of ozone precursors emissions ( based on the work by van Aardenne et al. ( 2001)), we have found a tropospheric ozone burden increase of 71 Tg between 1890 and 1990, an increase of similar to 30\%. When no anthropogenic emissions in 1890 are considered, this burden increase reaches 88 Tg. The ozone lifetime is shown to have decreased by similar to 30\%, especially after 1930. It is also shown that the net chemical production in the lower troposphere exceeded that in the free troposphere for the first time in the 1950 - 1970 period. In addition, the ozone production in this study increased rapidly between 1890 and 1930 and from 1970 to 1990. However, the ozone production efficiency in the troposphere is shown to have decreased during the 20th century, making the troposphere less NOx limited. Finally, a decrease in the OH burden is estimated to be on the order of 8\%, matched by a similar increase in the CO lifetime.},

	abstract = {Improved estimates of the radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone increases since the preindustrial have been calculated with the tropospheric chemistry model used at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) within the GISS general circulation model (GCM). The chemistry in this model has been expanded to include simplified representations of peroxyacetylnitrates and non-methane hydrocarbons in addition to background NOx-HOx-O-x-CO-CH4 chemistry. The GCM has improved resolution and physics in the boundary layer, improved resolution near the tropopause, and now contains a full representation of stratospheric dynamics. Simulations of present-day conditions show that this coupled chemistry-climate model is better able to reproduce observed tropospheric ozone, especially in the tropopause region, which is critical to climate forcing. Comparison with preindustrial simulations gives a global annual average radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increases of 0.30 W/m(2) with standard assumptions for preindustrial emissions. Locally, the forcing reaches more than 0.8 W/m(2) in parts of the northern subtropics during spring and summer, and is more than 0.6 W/m(2) through nearly all the Northern subtropics and mid-latitudes during summer. An alternative preindustrial simulation with soil NOx emissions reduced by two-thirds and emissions of isoprene, paraffins and alkenes from vegetation increased by 50\% gives a forcing of 0.33 W/m(2). Given the large uncertainties in preindustrial ozone amounts, the true value may lie well outside this range.},

Multispectral images in eight distinct bands of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) were used to derive a confidence in clear sky ( or alternatively the probability of cloud) over five different ecosystems. Based on the results of individual tests run as part of this cloud mask, an algorithm was developed to estimate the phase of the clouds ( liquid water, ice, or undetermined phase). Finally, the cloud optical thickness and effective radius were derived for both water and ice clouds that were detected during one flight line on 4 June.This analysis shows that the cloud mask developed for operational use on MODIS, and tested using MAS data in Alaska, is quite capable of distinguishing clouds from bright sea ice surfaces during daytime conditions in the high Arctic. Results of individual tests, however, make it difficult to distinguish ice clouds over snow and sea ice surfaces, so additional tests were added to enhance the confidence in the thermodynamic phase of clouds over the Chukchi Sea. The cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals used three distinct bands of the MAS, with a recently developed 1.62- and 2.13-mum-band algorithm being used quite successfully over snow and sea ice surfaces. These results are contrasted with a MODIS-based algorithm that relies on spectral reflectance at 0.87 and 2.13 mum.},

Here, a stochastic cloud generator is introduced to produce the subcolumns. The generator creates a cloud field on a column-by-column basis using information about layer cloud fraction, vertical overlap of cloud fraction and cloud condensate for adjacent layers, and density functions describing horizontal variations in cloud water content. The performance of the generator is assessed using a single day's worth of data from an LSAM simulation that employed a low-resolution two-dimensional cloud-resolving model (CRM) within each LSAM column (a total of similar to59000 cloudy domains). Statistical characteristics of generated cloud fields are compared against original CRM data, and radiative-transfer biases associated with the generator are evaluated. When the generator is initialized to the greatest extent possible with information obtained from the CRM fields. overall biases are small. For example, global-mean total cloud fraction exhibits a bias of -0.004, as compared with -0.024 for maximum-random overlap (MRO) and 0.047 for random overlap. Biases in radiative fluxes and heating rates are in general 1/4 to 1/2 those for MRO with horizontally homogeneous clouds.},

	abstract = {In this study, we examine how emissions from the Indian subcontinent modify the microphysical properties of trade wind cumulus clouds over the Indian Ocean. In situ microphysical data from 18 National Center for Atmospheric Research C130 research flights during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) in February-March 1999, in polluted to pristine regions, as delineated from the concentrations of condensation nuclei (CN), were analyzed. Cloud properties were found to vary in a systematic way during the five gradient flights: i.e., those flights in which the C130 flew from about 4.5 degrees N latitude in the high-CN regions, South across the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) into the clean regime, then farther south to about 8 degrees S latitude. The high-CN regime contained relatively large concentrations of small droplets as compared to the low-CN regime, where low concentrations of large droplets, and more frequent drizzle, were measured. An analysis of the data from penetrations into thousands of clouds during all 18 flights supports these qualitative observations: In the polluted regions, the droplet concentrations were a factor of 3 higher, the droplet effective diameters were 35\% smaller, and drizzle was observed 25\% as often than in the pristine regions; in both polluted and pristine regions, the bulk cloud properties (liquid water content (LWC), vertical velocity, cloud horizontal dimensions) were approximately the same. Even larger differences in the microphysical properties between the high-CN, intermediate-CN, and low-CN regimes were noted when the data set was partitioned by the LWC. A high ratio offorward scattering spectrometer probe (FSSP) to CN concentrations was noted in the low-CN regime, whereas in the high-CN regime this ratio was small. Droplet growth calculations in an adiabatic, 1D parcel model over a 300 m cloud depth support the droplet observations and indicate that the cloud optical depths in the high CN regime could have been as large as twice those in the low CN regime as a result of differences in the cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) population. The corresponding albedos of about 0.54 in the high CN regime and 0.47 in the low CN regime signify potentially large differences in albedo for the typical vertical velocities observed in INDOEX clouds, but it is unclear how entrainment would affect this difference. The calculations indicate that stronger updrafts associated with deep convection could lead to a larger difference between the microphysics of high-CN and low-CN regions.},

	abstract = {Liquid water path (LWP) mesoscale spatial variability in marine low cloud over the eastern subtropical oceans is examined using two months of daytime retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Terra satellite. Approximately 20 000 scenes of size 256 km X 256 km are used in the analysis. It is found that cloud fraction is strongly linked with the LWP variability in the cloudy fraction of the scene. It is shown here that in most cases LWP spatial variance is dominated by horizontal scales of 10-50 km, and increases as the variance-containing scale increases, indicating the importance of organized mesoscale cellular convection (MCC). A neural network technique is used to classify MODIS scenes by the spatial variability type (no MCC, closed MCC, open MCC, cellular but disorganized). It is shown how the different types tend to occupy distinct geographical regions and different physical regimes within the subtropics, although the results suggest considerable overlap of the large-scale meteorological conditions associated with each scene type. It is demonstrated that both the frequency of occurrence, and the variance-containing horizontal scale of the MCC increases as the marine boundary layer (MBL) depth increases. However, for the deepest MBLs, the MCC tends to be replaced by clouds containing cells but lacking organization. In regions where MCC is prevalent, a lack of sensitivity of the MCC type (open or closed) to the large-scale meteorology was found, suggesting a mechanism internal to the MBL may be important in determining MCC type. The results indicate that knowledge of the physics of MCC will be required to completely understand and predict low cloud coverage and variability in the subtropics.},

	abstract = {Stratocumulus clouds are common in the tropical and subtropical marine boundary layer, and understanding these clouds is important due to their significant impact on the earth's radiation budget. Observations show that the marine boundary layer contains complex, but poorly understood processes, which, from time to time, result in the observable self-organization of cloud structures at scales ranging from a few to a few thousand kilometers. Such shallow convective cloud features, typically observed as hexagonal cells, are known generally as mesoscale cellular convection (MCC). Actinoform clouds are rarer, but visually more striking forms of MCC, which possess a radial structure.Because mesoscale cloud features are typically too large to be observed from the ground, observations of hexagonal cells historically date only to the beginning of satellite meteorology. Examples of actinoform clouds were shown in the venerable "Picture of the Month" series in Monthly Weather Review in the early 1960s, but these clouds were generally forgotten as research focused on hexagonal cells.Recent high-resolution satellite images have, in a sense, "rediscovered" actinoform clouds, and they appear to be much more prevalent than had been previously suspected. We show a number of examples of actinoform clouds from a variety of locations worldwide. In addition, we have conducted a detailed case study of an actinoform cloud system using data from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), including analysis of cloud heights, radiative properties, and the time-evolution of the cloud system. We also examine earlier theories regarding actinoform clouds in light of the new satellite data.},

	abstract = {A survey of the frequency and characteristics of precipitation from low clouds over the oceans based on data from CloudSat and CALIPSO from July 2006 through June 2007 is presented. The low-cloud fraction, drizzle occurrence, and estimated cloud base precipitation rate are examined globally and for eight subtropical and midlatitude stratocumulus (Sc) regions. This analysis is restricted clouds below 4 km. Drizzle detection and characterization is further restricted to clouds with tops above 1 km altitude. The maximum radar reflectivity within an individual CloudSat profile (Zmax) is used to classify the profile as precipitating or nonprecipitating. The distribution of Zmax for all profiles is bimodal with peaks around -23 and -12 dBZ interpreted as originating from populations of nondrizzling and drizzling clouds, respectively. Profiles where Zmax exceeds -18 dBZ are classified as drizzling. Drizzle is detected for 19-34\% of cloudy profiles in the subtropical Sc regions and 37-44\% of profiles from the midlatitude Sc regions. The cloud base precipitation rate is estimated using the relation: Rcb = 2 · Zmax0.7. The lower quartile/median/upper quartile precipitation rates are 0.25/0.6/2.0 mm d-1 for the subtropical Sc regions and 0.28/0.7/2.3 mm d-1 for midlatitude regions. A consistent nighttime increase in low-cloud fraction and drizzle occurrence is observed for the subtropical Sc regions. For clouds with reff {\textgreater} 17 μm the drizzle occurrence can be treated as a function of LWP alone and exceeds 50\% (75\%) for a LWP of 50 (110) g m-2. For reff {\textless} 17 the drizzle occurrence is strongly dependent on both LWP and reff.},

	abstract = {The importance of NOx production by lightning in the tropics has been assessed by using satellite lightning measurements from the Lightning Image Sensor (LIS). The lightning data from LIS over the period of 1998-2000 are analyzed and partitioned based on the latitude to obtain the numbers of cloud-to-ground (CG) and cloud-to-cloud (intracloud or IC) flashes. The average annual lightning counts over the 3-yr period are 3.0 x 10(8) CG flashes and 1.1 x 10(9) IC flashes between 35degreesN and 35degreesS. The resulting lightning distributions are employed to calculate the production of NOx. We obtain a lightning NOx production of 6.3TgNyr(-1) over this latitudinal region, using representative production values of 6.7 x 10(26) and 6.7 x 10(25) NO molecules for each CG and IC flash, respectively. NOx production by lightning varies slightly on a seasonal basis in accordance with the lightning distribution, with the maximum production occurring in the months of September, October, and November. The geographical and seasonal production of NOx by lightning is compared to NOx emissions from other sources (i.e., from anthropogenic activity, biomass burning, and soil emissions). The results indicate that production of NOx by tropical lightning is significant throughout the year. Lightning accounts for almost all of the NOx emitted over the oceans and 50-90\% of NOx emitted over some continental areas on a seasonal basis. On the annual basis, the contribution of lightning to total NOx production is 23\% in the tropics, and globally the lightning NOx production occurs predominately in this region. The uncertainty in estimating NOx production by lightning over the tropics is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The near- infrared absorption coefficient differs by as much as a factor of 2 from the prior compilation at some wavelengths. The midinfrared absorption coefficient is rather uncertain in the weakly absorbing regions near 9 and 20 mm. New far- infrared measurements at low temperatures are extrapolated to higher temperatures, which shifts the peak positions. New microwave measurements find absorption much weaker than previously reported, by factors of 2 - 5. The real part of the index of refraction is computed using Kramers- Kronig analysis; it differs from the prior compilation only in the far infrared.

The complete vorticity equation is employed for the analysis.

This is confirmed by a series of numerical experiments. The horizontal gradient of the condensation heating also affects the configuration of the subtropical anticyclone. It is concluded that condensation heating is a key factor for the formation and location of the summer subtropical anticyclone in the EH. The latent heating released by the Asian monsoon rainfall contributes to the formation of the 200 hPa South Asian anticyclone on the western side of the heating center and the 500 hPa western Pacific subtropical anticyclone on the eastern side of the center. Such configurations are modified to some extent by surface sensible heating and orography.

Horizontal transport of water vapor can also explain how a persistent layer of subvisible cirrus can exist near the tropopause in the cold trap even though observations suggest that there is diabatic cooling and subsidence, rather than diabatic heating and rising through the tropopause in this region. Thus, horizontal transport in the tropical transition layer in the vicinity of the tropopause plays an important role in the water balance of the stratosphere.},

Our approach is to couple a global 3-D model of tropospheric chemistry (GEOS-CHEM) with aerosol fields from a global 3-D aerosol model (GOCART). Reactive uptake by aerosols is computed using reaction probabilities from a recent review (gamma(HO2) = 0.2, gamma(NO2) =10(-4), gamma(NO3) = 10(-3)). Aerosols decrease the O-3 –{\textgreater} O(D-1) photolysis frequency by 5-20\% at the surface throughout the Northern Hemisphere (largely due to mineral dust) and by a factor of 2 in biomass burning regions (largely due to black carbon). Aerosol uptake of HO2 accounts for 10-40\% of total HOx radical (= OH + peroxy) loss in the boundary layer over polluted continental regions (largely due to sulfate and organic carbon) and for more than 70\% over tropical biomass burning regions (largely due to organic carbon). Uptake of NO2 and NO3 accounts for 10-20\% of total HNO3 production over biomass burning regions and less elsewhere. Annual mean OH concentrations decrease by 9\% globally and by 5-35\% in the boundary layer over the Northern Hemisphere. Simulated CO increases by 5-15 ppbv in the remote Northern Hemisphere, improving agreement with observations. Simulated boundary layer O-3 decreases by 15-45 ppbv over India during the biomass burning season in March and by 5-9 ppbv over northern Europe in August, again improving comparison with observations. We find that particulate matter controls would increase surface O-3 over Europe and other industrial regions.},

	abstract = {An investigation of the generation of turbulence above deep convection is presented. This investigation is motivated by an encounter between a commercial passenger aircraft and severe turbulence above a developing thunderstorm near Dickinson, North Dakota, on 10 July 1997. Very high-resolution two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations are used to investigate the possible causes of the turbulence encounter. These simulations explicitly resolve the convection and the turbulence-causing instabilities. The configurations of the models are consistent with the meteorological conditions surrounding the event.The turbulence generated in the numerical simulations can be placed into two general categories. The first category includes turbulence that remains local to the cloud top, and the second category includes turbulence that propagates away from the convection and owes its existence to the breakdown of convectively generated gravity waves. In both the two- and three-dimensional calculations, the local turbulence develops rapidly and occupies a layer about 1 km deep above the top of convective updrafts after their initial overshoot into the stratosphere. This local turbulence is generated by the highly nonlinear interactions between the overshooting convective updrafts and the tropopause. Gravity wave breakdown is only present in the two- dimensional calculation and occurs in a layer about 3 km deep and 30 km long. This gravity wave breakdown is attributed to an interaction between the gravity waves and a critical level induced by the background wind shear and cloud-induced wind perturbations above cloud top.},

	abstract = {A temporally and spatially comprehensive depiction of the tropical tropopause is presented, based on radiosonde data from 83 stations. Climatological statistics for 1961-1990 are computed for three levels: the conventional lapse-rate tropopause (LRT), the cold-point tropopause (CPT), and the 100 hPa level. Mean values and seasonal and interannual variations of temperature, pressure, height, potential temperature, and water vapor saturation mixing ratio at these levels are compared. The tropopause is higher, colder, and at lower pressure in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in NH winter. This pattern reverses in NH summer, except that the tropopause remains colder in the NH than in the SH. The climatological locations of minimum tropopause temperature differ from those of maximum height and minimum pressure: In NH winter the tropopause is coldest over the western tropical Pacific warm pool region, but it is highest and at lowest pressure over the western Atlantic. Correlations of interannual anomalies in zonal-mean characteristics reveal that the height of the tropopause reflects the temperature of the underlying troposphere. Tropopause. temperature, on the other hand, shows little association with tropospheric characteristics but is significantly correlated with the temperature and pressure of the lower stratosphere. The 100 hPa level is a poor surrogate for the tropical tropopause. Changes in radiosonde instrumentation limit the potential for detecting tropopause trends. However, the following (nonmonotonic) trends in the tropopause in the deep tropics during 1978-1997 seem robust: an increase in height of about 20 m decade(-1), a decrease in pressure of about 0.5 hPa decade(-1), a cooling of about 0.5 K decade(-1), little change in potential temperature, and a decrease in saturation volume mixing ratio of about 0.3 ppmv decade(-1).},

	abstract = {The properties of midlatitude cirrus clouds are examined using one year of continuous vertically pointing millimeter-wave cloud radar data collected at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Southern Great Plains site in Oklahoma. The goal of this analysis is to present the cloud characteristics in a manner that will aid in the evaluation and improvement of cirrus parameterizations in large-scale models. Using a temperature- and radar reflectivity-based definition of cirrus, the occurrence frequency of cirrus, the vertical location and thickness of cirrus layers, and other fundamental statistics are examined. Also the bulk microphysical properties of optically thin cirrus layers that occur in isolation from other cloud layers are examined. During 1997, it is found that cirrus were present 22\% of the time, had a mean layer thickness of 2.0 km, and were most likely to occur in the 8.5-10-km height range. On average, the cirrus clouds tended to be found in layers in which the synoptic-scale vertical velocity was weakly ascending. The mean synoptic-scale vertical motion in the upper troposphere as derived from Rapid Update Cycle model output was +0.2 cm s(-1). However, a significant fraction of the layers (33\%) were found where the upper-tropospheric large-scale vertical velocity was clearly descending (w{\textless} -1.5 cm s(-1)). Microphysical properties were computed for that subset of cirrus events that were optically thin (infrared emissivity {\textless} 0.85) and occurred with no lower cloud layers. This subset of cirrus had mean values of ice water path, effective radius, and ice crystal concentration of 8 g m(-2),35 mum, and 100 L-1, respectively. Although all the cloud properties demonstrated a high degree of variability during the period considered, the statistics of these properties were fairly steady throughout the annual cycle. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the cloud microphysical properties appear to be strongly correlated to the cloud layer thickness and mean temperature. Use of these results for parameterization of cirrus properties in large-scale models is discussed.},

The intercept of the relationship is determined primarily by aerosol properties, and the slope by cloud properties.

This study uses a unique combination of satellite and shipborne Doppler radar data including both horizontal and vertical cross sections through drizzle cells. Stratocumulus cloud structure was classified as closed cellular, open cellular, or unclassifiable using infrared satellite images. Distributions of drizzle cell structure, size, and intensity are similar among the cloud-structure categories, though the open-cellular distributions are shifted toward higher values. Stronger and larger drizzle cells preferentially occur when the cloud field is broken (open-cellular and unclassifiable categories). Satellite observations of cloud structure may be useful to indicate the most likely distribution of rain rates associated with a set of scenes, but infrared data alone are not sufficient to develop routine precipitation retrievals for marine stratocumulus. Individual drizzle cells about 2-20 km across usually showed precipitation growth within the cloud layer and evaporation below, divergence near echo top, and convergence below cloud base. Diverging flow near the surface was also observed beneath heavily precipitating drizzle cells. As the cloud field transitioned from a closed to an open-cellular cloud structure, shipborne radar revealed prolific development of small drizzle cells ({\textless} 10 km(2)) that exceeded by over 5 times the number of total cells in either the preceding closed-cellular or following open-cellular periods. Peak area-average rain rates lagged by a few hours the peak in total number of drizzle cells. Based on observations from EPIC Sc, the highest stratocumulus rain rates are more likely to occur near the boundary between closed and open-cellular cloud structures.},

	abstract = {An algorithm has been developed to identify precipitation features (greater than or equal to 75 km(2) in size) in two land and two ocean regions during August, September, and October 1998. It uses data from two instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite: near-surface precipitation radar (PR) reflectivities, and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) 85.5-GHz polarization corrected temperatures (PCTs). These features were classified by size and intensity criteria to identify mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), precipitation with PCTs below 250 K, and other features without PCTs below 250 K. By using this technique, several hypotheses about the convective intensity and rainfall distributions of tropical precipitation systems can be evaluated. It was shown that features over land were much more intense than similar oceanic features as measured by their minimum PCTs, maximum heights of the 30-dBZ contour, and 6-km reflectivities. The diurnal cycle of precipitation features showed a strong afternoon maximum over land and a rather flat distribution over the ocean, quite similar to those found by others using infrared satellite techniques. Precipitation features with MCSs over the ocean contained significantly more rain outside the 250-K PCT isotherm than land systems, and in general, a significant portion (10\%-15\%) of rainfall in the Tropics falls in systems containing no PCTs less than 250 K.Volumetric rainfall and lightning characteristics las observed by the Lightning Imaging Sensor aboard TRMM) from the systems were classified by feature intensity; similar rain amounts but highly differing lightning flash rates were found among the regions. Oceanic storms have a bimodal contribution of rainfall from two types of systems: Very weak systems with little ice scattering and moderately strong systems that do not produce high lightning hash rates. Continental systems that produce the bulk of the rainfall las sampled) are likely to have higher lightning flash rates, which are shown to be linked to stronger radar and ice-scattering intensities.},

This rapid decline of clear-sky longwave cooling occurs because radiative emission from water vapor becomes inefficient above 200 hPa. The emission from water vapor becomes less important than the emission from CO2 because the saturation vapor pressure is so very low at the temperatures above 200 hPa. This suggests that the temperature at the detrainment level, and consequently the emission temperature of tropical anvil clouds, will remain constant during climate change. This constraint has very important implications for the potential role of tropical convective clouds in climate feedback, since it means that the emission temperatures of tropical anvil clouds and upper tropospheric water vapor are essentially independent of the surface temperature, so long as the tropopause is colder than the temperature where emission from water vapor becomes relatively small.},

The present study tests this hypothesis by investigating whether low-level cloud cover has decreased over the northern Indian Ocean between 1952 and 1996, a time period when south Asian anthropogenic emissions have greatly increased. The observed slight increase in cloud cover indicates that other processes must compensate soot solar heating.

	abstract = {Aircraft observations From three recent missions (STRAT, SUCCESS, SONEX) are synthesized into a theoretical analysis of the factors controlling the concentrations of HOx radicals (HOx = OH + peroxy) and the larger reservoir family HOy (HOy = HOx + 2H(2)O(2) + 2CH(3)OOH + HNO2 + HNO4) in the upper troposphere. Photochemical model calculations capture 66\% of the variance of observed HOx concentrations. Two master variables are found to determine the variance of the 24 h average HOx concentrations: the primary HOx production rate, P(HOx), and the concentration of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx = NO + NO2). We use these two variables as a coordinate system to diagnose the photochemistry of the upper troposphere and map the different chemical regimes. Primary HOx production is dominated by the O(D-1) + H2O reaction when [H2O] {\textgreater} 100 ppmv, and by photolysis of acetone (and possibly other convected HOx precursors) under drier conditions. For the principally northern midlatitude conditions sampled by the aircraft missions, the HOx yield from acetone photolysis ranges from 2 to 3. Methane oxidation amplifies the primary HOx source by a factor of 1.1-1.9. Chemical cycling within the HOx family has a chain length of 2.5-7, while cycling between the HOx family and its HOy reservoirs has a chain length of 1.6-2.2. The number of ozone molecules produced per HOy molecule consumed ranges from 4 to 12, such that ozone production rates vary between 0.3 and 5 ppbv d(-1) in the upper troposphere. Three chemical regimes (NOx-limited, transition, NOx-saturated) are identified to describe the dependence of HOx concentrations and ozone production rates on the two master variables P(HOx) and [NOx]. Simplified analytical expressions are derived to express these dependences as power laws for each regime. By applying an eigenlifetime analysis to the HOx-NOx-O-3 chemical system, we find that the decay of a perturbation to HOy in the upper troposphere las from deep convection) is represented by four dominant modes with the longest time scale being factors of 2-3 times longer than the steady-state lifetime of HOy.

The method is most applicable to stratiform-type precipitation. Measurements of radar backscatter from the ocean surface are combined with information about surface wind speed and sea surface temperature to derive the path-integrated attenuation through precipitating cloud systems. The scattering and extinction characteristics of raindrops are modeled using a combination of Mie theory (for raindrops) and the discrete dipole approximation (for ice crystals and melting snow), and a model of the melting layer is implemented to represent the transition between ice and liquid water. Backward Monte Carlo modeling is used to model multiple scattering from precipitating hydrometeors between the radar and ocean surface, which is shown to be significant for precipitation rates exceeding 3-5 mm h(-1), particularly when precipitating ice is present. An uncertainty analysis is presented and the algorithm is applied to near-global CloudSat observations and compared with other near-global precipitation sources. In the tropics, CloudSat tends to underestimate the heaviest precipitation. It is found that in the middle latitudes, however, CloudSat observes precipitation more often and with greater resulting accumulation than other spaceborne sensors.},

All models show a cloud semi-direct effect, indicating a rapid cloud response to CO2; cloud typically decreases, enhancing the warming. Similarly there is evidence of semi-direct effects from water-vapour, lapse-rate, ice and snow. Previous estimates of climate feedbacks are unlikely to have taken these semi-direct effects into account and so misinterpret processes as feedbacks that depend only on the forcing, but not the global surface temperature.

	abstract = {Climate geoengineering proposals seek to rectify the Earth's current and potential future radiative imbalance, either by reducing the absorption of incoming solar (shortwave) radiation, or by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and transferring it to long-lived reservoirs, thus increasing outgoing longwave radiation. A fundamental criterion for evaluating geoengineering options is their climate cooling effectiveness, which we quantify here in terms of radiative forcing potential. We use a simple analytical approach, based on energy balance considerations and pulse response functions for the decay of CO2 perturbations. This aids transparency compared to calculations with complex numerical models, but is not intended to be definitive. It allows us to compare the relative effectiveness of a range of proposals. We consider geoengineering options as additional to large reductions in CO2 emissions. By 2050, some land carbon cycle geoengineering options could be of comparable magnitude to mitigation 'wedges', but only stratospheric aerosol injections, albedo enhancement of marine stratocumulus clouds, or sunshades in space have the potential to cool the climate back toward its pre-industrial state. Strong mitigation, combined with global-scale air capture and storage, afforestation, and bio-char production, i.e. enhanced CO2 sinks, might be able to bring CO2 back to its pre-industrial level by 2100, thus removing the need for other geoengineering. Alternatively, strong mitigation stabilising CO2 at 500 ppm, combined with geoengineered increases in the albedo of marine stratiform clouds, grasslands, croplands and human settlements might achieve a patchy cancellation of radiative forcing. Ocean fertilisation options are only worthwhile if sustained on a millennial timescale and phosphorus addition may have greater long-term potential than iron or nitrogen fertilisation. Enhancing ocean upwelling or downwelling have trivial effects on any meaningful timescale. Our approach provides a common framework for the evaluation of climate geoengineering proposals, and our results should help inform the prioritisation of further research into them.},

	abstract = {A unified tropospheric chemistry-aerosol model has been developed within the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation model (GCM). The model includes a detailed simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry as well as aerosols and aerosol precursors. Predicted aerosol species include sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, primary organic carbon, and secondary organic carbon. The partitioning of ammonia and nitrate between gas and aerosol phases is determined by online thermodynamic equilibrium, and the formation of secondary organic aerosols is based on equilibrium partitioning and experimentally determined parameters. Two-way coupling between aerosols and chemistry provides consistent chemical fields for aerosol dynamics and aerosol mass for heterogeneous processes and calculations of gas-phase photolysis rates. Although the current version of the unified model does not include a prognostic treatment of mineral dust, we include its effects on photolysis and heterogeneous processes by using three-dimensional off-line fields. We also simulate sulfate and nitrate aerosols that are associated with mineral dust based on currently available chemical understanding. Considering both mineral dust uptake of HNO3 and wet scavenging of HNO3 on ice leads to closer agreement between predicted gas-phase HNO3 concentrations and measurements than in previous global chemical transport model simulations, especially in the middle to upper troposphere. As a result of the coupling between chemistry and aerosols, global burdens of both gas-phase and aerosol species are predicted to respond nonlinearly to changing emissions of NOx, NH3, and sulfur.},

	abstract = {The study of climate and climate change is hindered by a lack of information on the effect of clouds on the radiation balance of the earth, referred to as the cloud-radiative forcing. Quantitative estimates of the global distributions of cloud-radiative forcing have been obtained from the spaceborne Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) launched in 1984. For the April 1985 period, the global shortwave cloud forcing [-44.5 watts per square meter (W/m$^{\textrm{2\$}}$)] due to the enhancement of planetary albedo, exceeded in magnitude the longwave cloud forcing (31.3 W/m$^{\textrm{2\$}}$) resulting from the greenhouse effect of clouds. Thus, clouds had a net cooling effect on the earth. This cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 W/m$^{\textrm{2\$}}$. The monthly averaged longwave cloud forcing reached maximum values of 50 to 100 W/m$^{\textrm{2\$}}$ over the convectively disturbed regions of the tropics. However, this heating effect is nearly canceled by a correspondingly large negative shortwave cloud forcing, which indicates the delicately balanced state of the tropics. The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO$_{\textrm{2}}$. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ doubling. Hence, small changes in the cloud-radiative forcing fields can play a significant role as a climate feedback mechanism. For example, during past glaciations a migration toward the equator of the field of strong, negative cloud-radiative forcing, in response to a similar migration of cooler waters, could have significantly amplified oceanic cooling and continental glaciation.},

	abstract = {A clustering algorithm is used to define the radiative, hydrological, and microphysical properties of precipitating convective events in the equatorial region observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Storms are separated by surface type, size, and updraft strength, the latter defined by the presence or absence of lightning. SST data and global reanalysis products are used to explore sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions. Small storms are much more numerous than mesoscale convective systems, and account for fairly little of the total rainfall but contribute significantly to reflection of sunlight. Lightning storms rain more heavily, have greater cloud area, extend to higher altitude, and have higher albedos than storms without lightning. Lightning is favored by a steep lower-troposphere lapse rate and moist midlevel humidity. Storms occur more often at SST greater than or equal to 28degreesC and with strong upward 500-mb mean vertical velocity. In general, storms over warmer ocean waters rain more heavily, are larger, and have higher cloud tops, but they do not have noticeably higher albedos than storms over cooler ocean waters. Mesoscale convective system properties are more sensitive to SST. Rain rates and cloud-top heights increase statistically significantly with mean upward motion. Rain rates increase with albedo and cloud-top height over ocean, but over land there are also storms with cloud-top temperatures {\textgreater} -35degreesC whose rain rates decrease with increasing albedo. Both the fraction of available moisture that rains out and the fraction that detrains as ice increase with SST, the former faster than the latter. TRMM ice water paths derived from cloud-resolving models but constrained by observed microwave radiances are only weakly correlated with observed albedo. The results are inconsistent with the "adaptive iris” hypothesis and suggest feedbacks due primarily to increasing convective cloud cover with warming, but more weakly than predicted by the "thermostat” hypothesis.},

We generalize the connection between compressibility maxima and freezing to aqueous solutions. Utilizing compressibility data, we predict solution freezing temperatures from those of pure water under pressure. These predictions are almost coincident with the parameterizations of droplet freezing temperatures in terms of water activity [ Koop et al., 2000] used to predict ice formation in cirrus clouds. Our work then provides a physical basis for this link between water activity in solution and homogeneous freezing temperatures.},

Eight weeks of nearly continuous S-band polarimetric radar sampling, 57 flights from three heavily instrumented research aircraft, and a suite of ground- and ship-based instrumentation provided data on trade wind clouds with unprecedented resolution.

The Control Case CC had no IPP, whereas the two experiments E1 and E2 invoked IPP with two different hydrometeor-freezing assumptions. Case E1 froze liquid hydrometeors at subfreezing temperatures at detrainment. Case E2 also froze new condensate generated at subfreezing temperatures of the cumulus updrafts. However, melting of falling frozen hydrometeors occurred at the very first encounter with above freezing temperatures in both simulations. Comparative analysis showed discernible differences in cloud and condensation heating climatologies of these simulations. Specifically, IPP influenced convective detrainment at mid- and deep-levels in accord with TOGA-COARE observations. The study suggests that IPP can mitigate less-than-observed mid-level clouds and overabundance of deep clouds and might invigorate cumulus-induced downdrafts.},

This high degree of supercooling was attributed to the small droplet size and the lack of ice nuclei at the heights of these clouds(1,2). For deep convective clouds, which have much larger droplets near their tops and which take in aerosols from near the ground, no such measurements have hitherto been reported. However, satellite data suggest that highly supercooled water (down to -38 degrees C) frequently occurs in vigorous continental convective storms(3). Here we report in situ measurements in deep convective clouds from an aircraft, showing that most of the condensed water remains liquid down to -37.5 degrees C. The droplets reach a median volume diameter of 17 mu m and amount to 1.8 g m(-3), one order of magnitude more than previously reported 2. At slightly colder temperatures only ice was found, suggesting homogeneous freezing.

	abstract = {The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) dominates the variability of the equatorial stratosphere (similar to 16-50 km) and is easily seen as downward propagating easterly and westerly wind regimes, with a variable period averaging approximately 28 months. From a fluid dynamical perspective, the QBO is a fascinating example of a coherent, oscillating mean flow that is driven by propagating waves with periods unrelated to that of the resulting oscillation, Although the QBO is a tropical phenomenon, it affects the stratospheric flow from pole to pole by modulating the effects of extratropical waves. Indeed, study of the QBO is inseparable from the study of atmospheric wave motions that drive it and are modulated by it. The QBO affects variability in the mesosphere near 85 km by selectively filtering waves that propagate upward through the equatorial stratosphere, and may also affect the strength of Atlantic hurricanes. The effects of the QBO are not confined to atmospheric dynamics. Chemical constituents, such as ozone, water vapor, and methane, are affected by circulation changes induced by the QBO. There are also substantial QBO signals in many of the shorter-lived chemical constituents. Through modulation of extratropical wave propagation, the QBO has an effect on the breakdown of the wintertime stratospheric polar vortices and the severity of high-latitude ozone depletion. The polar vortex in the stratosphere affects surface weather patterns, providing a mechanism for the QBO to have an effect at the Earth's surface. As more data sources (e.g., wind and temperature measurements from both ground-based systems and satellites) become available, the effects of the QBO can be more precisely assessed. This review covers the current state of knowledge of the tropical QBO, its extratropical dynamical effects, chemical constituent transport, and effects of the QBO in the troposphere (similar to0-16 km) and mesosphere (similar to 50-100 km). It is intended to provide a broad overview of the QBO and its effects to researchers outside the held, as well as a source of information and references for specialists. The history of research on the QBO is discussed only briefly, and the reader is referred to several historical review papers. The basic theory of the QBO is summarized, and tutorial references are provided.},

Here we present observations showing the contrary; the effect of dust on cloud properties is to inhibit precipitation. Using satellite and aircraft observations we show that clouds forming within desert dust contain small droplets and produce little precipitation by drop coalescence. Measurement of the size distribution and the chemical analysis of individual saharan dust particles collected in such a dust storm suggest a possible mechanism for the diminished rainfall. The detrimental impact of dust on rainfall is smaller than that caused by smoke from biomass burning or anthropogenic air pollution, but the large abundance of desert dust in the atmosphere renders it important. The reduction of precipitation from clouds affected by desert dust can cause drier soil, which in turn raises more dust, thus providing a possible feedback loop to further decrease precipitation. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes of land use exposing the topsoil can initiate such a desertification feedback process.},

Both data sources suffer either from low global coverage or poor vertical resolution. The GPS RO technique, on the other hand, is characterized by global coverage, high vertical resolution, all-weather viewing, and long-term stability. CHAMP RO data are available since February 2001. Since May 2001, up to 200 high- resolution temperature profiles per day are available. The temperature bias between CHAMP temperature profiles and radiosonde data as well as ECMWF analyses is less than 0.5 K between 300-30 hPa. On the basis of the May 2001 to November 2003 data set of CHAMP RO data the structure and temporal and spatial variability of the tropical tropopause based on several tropopause definitions (thermal and cold-point tropopause) are discussed. This includes an overview of the global tropopause characteristics, the discussion of the annual cycle and the latitudinal-longitudinal structure of the tropical tropopause. In the CHAMP RO temperature data, clear evidence of the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) was found. The goal of this study is to show the potential of GPS RO for global monitoring of the temperature demonstrated exemplarily for the tropical UTLS region and based on the first 31 months (as of November 2003) of CHAMP RO data.},

	abstract = {Several papers have described a significant trend toward the positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) in recent decades. The SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) so such a change implies a major shift in the broadscale climate of this hemisphere. However, the majority of these studies have used NCEP - NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data, which are known to have spurious negative trends in SH high-latitude pressure. Thus, given that the SAM describes the relative atmospheric anomalies at mid-and high southern latitudes, these errors in the NNR data have the potential to invalidate the published findings on changes in the SAM. Therefore, it is important that a "true” benchmark of trends in the SAM is available against which future climate scenarios as revealed through climate models can be examined.In this paper this issue is addressed by employing an empirical definition of the SAM so that station data can be utilized to evaluate true temporal changes: six stations are used to calculate a proxy zonal mean sea level pressure (MSLP) at both 408 and 658S during 1958 - 2000. The observed increase in the difference in zonal MSLP between 408 ( increasing) and 658S ( decreasing) is shown to be statistically significant, with the trend being most pronounced since the mid-1970s. However, it is demonstrated that calculated trends in the MSLP difference between 408 and 658S and the SAM itself are exaggerated by a factor of 3 and 2, respectively, in the NNR. The SH high-latitude errors in the early part of this reanalysis are greatest in winter as are subsequent improvements. As a result, the NNR shows the greatest seasonal trend in the SAM to be in the austral winter, in marked contrast to observational data, which reveal the largest real increase to be in summer.Equivalent data from two ECMWF reanalyses, including part of the new ERA-40 reanalysis, are also examined. It is demonstrated that ERA-40 provides an improved representation of SH high-latitude atmospheric circulation variability that can be used with high confidence at least as far back as 1973 - and is therefore ideal for examining the recent trend in the SAM - and with more confidence than the NNR right back to 1958.},

	abstract = {A new three-dimensional cloud resolving model (CRM) has been developed to study the statistical properties of cumulus convection. The model was applied to simulate a 28-day evolution of clouds over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains site during the summer 1997 Intensive Observation Period. The model was forced by the large-scale advective tendencies and surface fluxes derived from the observations. The sensitivity of the results to the domain dimensionality and size, horizontal grid resolution, and parameterization of microphysics has been tested. In addition, the sensitivity to perturbed initial conditions has also been tested using a 20-member ensemble of runs.The model captures rather well the observed temporal evolution of the precipitable water and precipitation rate, although it severely underestimates the shaded cloud fraction possibly because of an inability to account for the lateral advection of clouds over the ARM site. The ensemble runs reveal that the uncertainty of the simulated precipitable water due to the fundamental uncertainty of the initial conditions can be as large as 25\% of the mean values. Even though the precipitation rates averaged over the whole simulation period were virtually identical among the ensemble members, the timing uncertainty of the onset and reaching the precipitation maximum can be as long as one full day. Despite the predictability limitations, the mean simulation statistics are found to be almost insensitive to the uncertainty of the initial conditions.The overall effects of the third spatial dimension are found to be minor for simulated mean fields and scalar fluxes but are quite considerable for velocity and scalar variances. Neither changes in a rather wide range of the domain size nor the horizontal grid resolution have any significant impact on the simulations. Although a rather strong sensitivity of the mean hydrometeor profiles and, consequently, cloud fraction to the microphysics parameters is found, the effects on the predicted mean temperature and humidity profiles are shown to be modest. It is found that the spread among the time series of the simulated cloud fraction, precipitable water, and surface precipitation rate due to changes in the microphysics parameters is within the uncertainty of the ensemble runs. This suggests that correlation of the CRM simulations to the observed long time series of the aforementioned parameters cannot be generally used to validate the microphysics scheme.},

We show that the global mean OH concentration is also very sensitive to LtNO(x). Furthermore, despite the fact that the largest changes in NOx due to lightning are in the upper troposphere, where reactions with OH are generally slower, we find that the sensitivity of the mean tropospheric lifetime of methane (CH4) and methylchloroform (CH3CCl3) to assumptions about LtNO(x) are as large as the sensitivity of the tropospheric O-3 burden.

Each surface report is matched to the corresponding ISCCP-C1 report for the time of observation for the 280 km x 280 km grid box containing that observation. Classes of the surface reports are identified in which a particular cloud type was reported present, either alone or in combination with other clouds. For each class, cloud amounts from both surface and C1 data, base heights from surface data, and the frequency distributions of cloud-top pressure (p(c)) and optical thickness (tau) from C1 data are averaged over 15 degrees latitude zones, for land and ocean separately, for 3-month seasons. The frequency distribution of pc and t is plotted for each of the surface-defined cloud types occurring both alone and with other clouds.The average cloud-top pressures within a grid box do not always correspond well with values expected for a reported cloud type, particularly for the higher clouds Ci, Ac, and Cb. In many cases this is because the satellites also detect clouds within the grid box that are outside the field of view of the surface observer. The highest average cloud tops are found for the most extensive cloud type, Ns, averaging 7 km globally and reaching 9 km in the ITCZ. Nimbostratus also has the greatest average retrieved optical thickness, tau approximate to 20. Cumulonimbus clouds may actually attain far greater heights and depths, but they do not fill the grid box.The tau -p(c) distributions show features that distinguish the high, middle, and low clouds reported by the surface observers. However, the distribution patterns for the individual low cloud types (Cu, Sc, St) occurring alone overlap to such an extent that it is not possible to distinguish these cloud types from each other on the basis of tau -p(c) values alone. Other cloud types whose tau -p(c) distributions are indistinguishable are Cb, Ns, and thick As. However, the tau -p(c) distribution patterns for the different low cloud types are nevertheless distinguishable when all occurrences of a low cloud type are included, indicating that the different low types differ in their probabilities of co-occurrence with middle and high clouds.},

	abstract = {Recent satellite observations reveal far-reaching effects of the Hawaiian Islands on surface wind, cloud, ocean current, and sea surface temperature (SST) that extend leeward over an unusually long distance ({\textgreater}1000 km). A three-dimensional regional atmospheric model with full physics is used to investigate the cause of this long wake. While previous wind-wake studies tend to focus on regions near the islands, the emphasis here is the far-field effects of SST and orography well away from the Hawaiian Islands. In response to an island-induced SST pattern, the model produces surface wind and cloud anomaly patterns that resemble those observed by satellites. In particular, anomalous surface winds are found to converge onto a zonal band of warmer water, with cloud liquid water content enhanced over it but reduced on the northern and southern sides. In the vertical, a two-cell meridional circulation develops of a baroclinic structure with the rising motion and thicker clouds over the warm water band. The model response in the wind and cloud fields supports the hypothesis that ocean atmosphere interaction is crucial for sustaining the island effects over a few thousand kilometers.Near Hawaii, mountains generate separate wind wakes in the model lee of individual islands as observed by satellites. Under orographic forcing, the model simulates the windward cloud line and the southwest-tilted cloud band leeward of the Big Island. In the far field, orographically induced wind perturbations are found to be in geostrophic balance with pressure anomalies, indicative of quasigeostrophic Rossby wave propagation. A shallow-water model is developed for disturbances trapped in the inversion-capped planetary boundary layer. The westward propagation of Rossby waves is found to increase the wake length significantly, consistent with the three-dimensional simulation.},

S-band reflectivity measurements Z were converted to rainfall rates R using a Z-R relationship derived from aircraft measurements. Daily rainfall rates varied from 0 to 22 mm day(-1). The area-averaged rainfall rate for the 62-day period was 2.37 mm day(-1). If corrected for evaporation below cloud base, this value is reduced to 2.23 mm day(-1), which translates to a latent heat flux to the atmosphere of 63 W m(-2). When compared with the wintertime ocean-surface latent heat flux from this region, the average return of water to the ocean through precipitation processes within the trade wind layer during RICO was 31\%-39\%. A weak diurnal cycle was observed in the area-averaged rainfall rate. The magnitude of the rainfall and the frequency of its occurrence had a maximum in the predawn hours and a minimum in the midmorning to early afternoon on 64\% of the days. Radar data were collocated with data from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) to develop relationships between cloud-top height, cloud fraction, 866-nm bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), and radar-derived precipitation. The collocation took place at the overpass time of; 1045 local time.

It is shown that the diurnal variation of the tropospheric large-scale forcing has a strong in-phase relationship with convection, whereas the diurnal variations of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as the thermodynamic properties of the near-surface air are nearly out of phase with that of convection. Both the single column version and the full global model of the NCAR CCM3 are used to test the roles of the tropospheric and boundary layer forcing in the observed diurnal variation of convection. When convection is parameterized based on the tropospheric large-scale forcing, the diurnal variation of convection is in good agreement with the observations.},

This proposal stems from an observed correlation between cosmic ray intensity and Earth's average cloud cover over the course of one solar cycle. Some scientists question the reliability of the observations, whereas others, who accept them as reliable, suggest that the correlation may be caused by other physical phenomena with decadal periods or by a response to volcanic activity or El Nino. Nevertheless, the observation has raised the intriguing possibility that a cosmic ray-cloud interaction may help explain how a relatively small change in solar output can produce much larger changes in Earth's climate. Physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain how cosmic rays could affect clouds, but they need to be investigated further if the observation is to become more than just another correlation among geophysical variables.},

	abstract = {Despite recent improvements in satellite instrument calibration and the algorithms used to determine reflected solar (SW) and emitted thermal (LW) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes, a sizeable imbalance persists in the average global net radiation at the TOA from satellite observations. This imbalance is problematic in applications that use earth radiation budget (ERB) data for climate model evaluation, estimate the earth's annual global mean energy budget, and in studies that infer meridional heat transports. This study provides a detailed error analysis of TOA fluxes based on the latest generation of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) gridded monthly mean data products [the monthly TOA/surface averages geostationary (SRBAVG-GEO)] and uses an objective constrainment algorithm to adjust SW and LW TOA fluxes within their range of uncertainty to remove the inconsistency between average global net TOA flux and heat storage in the earth-atmosphere system. The 5-yr global mean CERES net flux from the standard CERES product is 6.5Wm(-2), much larger than the best estimate of 0.85Wm(-2) based on observed ocean heat content data and model simulations. The major sources of uncertainty in the CERES estimate are from instrument calibration (4.2Wm(-2)) and the assumed value for total solar irradiance (1Wm(-2)). After adjustment, the global mean CERES SW TOA flux is 99.5Wm(-2), corresponding to an albedo of 0.293, and the global mean LW TOA flux is 239.6Wm(-2). These values differ markedly from previously published adjusted global means based on the ERB Experiment in which the global mean SW TOA flux is 107Wm(-2) and the LW TOA flux is 234Wm(-2).},

In particular, the effects of solutes and mechanical pressure on the kinetics of the liquid-to-solid phase transition of supercooled water and aqueous solutions to ice have remained unresolved. Here we show from experimental data that the homogeneous nucleation of ice from supercooled aqueous solutions is independent of the nature of the solute, but depends only on the water activity of the solution-that is, the ratio between the water vapour pressures of the solution and of pure water under the same conditions. In addition, we show that the presence of solutes and the application of pressure have a very similar effect on ice nucleation. We present a thermodynamic theory for homogeneous ice nucleation, which expresses the nucleation rate coefficient as a function of water activity and pressure. Recent observations from clouds containing ice are in good agreement with our theory and our results should help to overcome one of the main weaknesses of numerical models of the atmosphere, the formulation of cloud processes.},

	abstract = {The impact of lightning on tropospheric reactive nitrogen NOx (NO + NO2) and nitrogen reservoir species (HNO3, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), N2O5, and HNO4) has been evaluated using a global chemical/transport model. Comparison of calculations made with and without lightning show that lightning has a significant effect on the nitrogen species on a global scale, resulting in significant enhancements of NOx HNO3 and PAN over the no lightning case. Of the nitrogen species, HNO3 is influenced the most, comprising approximately 60 to 80\% of the total increase in the nitrogen species concentration. The increase in PAN accounts for approximately 20 to 30\% of the nitrogen enhancement by lightning in the middle troposphere. In the lower troposphere of the tropics, NOx is rapidly converted into HNO3 due to the high OH concentration in this region. As a result, the enhancement in NOx from direct lightning emission is limited primarily to the upper troposphere. The conversion between NO, and less reactive nitrogen species (PAN and HNO3) also plays an important role in affecting NOx, especially over the oceans where lightning activity is low. The model results suggest that recycling of NOx from the lightning-enhanced PAN and HNO3 produces 2 to 10 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) increases in NOx over the oceans in the lower troposphere of the tropics. The enhancement of NOx over the oceans can partially explain the observations of NOx (mixing ratios of typically 10-50 pptv) over the tropical oceans, which are characterized by higher concentrations than would be expected from direct transport of NOx from the continents.},

	abstract = {The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) is a space-based instrument specifically designed to detect and locate lightning discharges as it orbits the Earth. This instrument is a scientific payload on the MicroLab-1 satellite that was launched into a 70degrees inclination low Earth orbit in April 1995. Given the orbital trajectory of the satellite, most regions of the Earth are observed by the OTD instrument more than 400 times during a 1 year period, and the average duration of each observation is 2 min. The OTD instrument optically detects lightning flashes that occur within its 1300x1300 km(2) field of view during both day and night conditions. A statistical examination of OTD lightning data reveals that nearly 1.4 billion flashes occur annually over the entire Earth. This annual flash count translates to an average of 44+/-5 lightning flashes (intracloud and cloud-to-ground combined) occurring around the globe every second, which is well below the traditional estimate of 100 fl s(-1) that was derived in 1925 from world thunder day records. The range of uncertainty for the OTD global totals represents primarily the uncertainty (and variability) in the flash detection efficiency of the instrument. The OTD measurements have been used to construct lightning climatology maps that demonstrate the geographical and seasonal distribution of lightning activity for the globe. An analysis of this annual lightning distribution confirms that lightning occurs mainly over land areas, with an average land/ocean ratio of similar to10:1. The Congo basin, which stands out year-round, shows a peak mean annual flash density of 80 fl km(-2) yr(-1) in Rwanda, and includes an area of over 3 million km(2) exhibiting flash densities greater than 30 fl km(-2) yr(-1) (the flash density of central Florida). Lightning is predominant in the northern Atlantic and western Pacific Ocean basins year-round where instability is produced from cold air passing over warm ocean water. Lightning is less frequent in the eastern tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean basins where the air mass is warmer. A dominant Northern Hemisphere summer peak occurs in the annual cycle, and evidence is found for a tropically driven semiannual cycle.},

These storms are important as they are very common along many tropical coasts and islands and are sometimes the precursors to large intense multicellular storms such as occur over the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin, Australia. All the storms sampled had a similar structure, with intense updrafts on the periphery of the cells producing significant-sized hail and downdrafts in the storm center. The hail concentrations are relatively small, but have a large effect on the radar reflectivity and polarimetric measurands because of the size (10-20 mm).

	abstract = {[1] Cloud layers in the troposphere influence photolysis rates (J values) and hence concentrations of chemical species. In order to study the impact of clouds on photolysis rates and oxidants, we have developed a simplified version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR) Tropospheric Ultraviolet-Visible (TUV) model and have coupled the simplified TUV ( otherwise known as the fast TUV (FTUV)) into the NCAR/ Atmospheric Chemistry Division global transport chemical model ( Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART-2)). The FTUV model has the same physical processes as the TUV model, except that the wavelength bins between 121 and 750 nm are reduced from 140 to 17. As a result, FTUV is about 8 times faster than the original TUV. Differences in the calculated photolysis rates between TUV and FTUV are generally less than 5\% in the troposphere. Subgrid vertical distributions of clouds are also considered in the calculation of photolysis rates in MOZART-2. The method used in this study is a mixed maximum and random overlap scheme. The subgrid method increases the computation time for photolysis rates by a factor of 3 compared to a simple method in which clouds are uniformly distributed over the MOZART-2 grids. Our calculation shows that the uniform cloud distribution method tends to significantly overestimate back scattering on the top of clouds and overestimates the impact on photochemistry in the troposphere. The results suggest that clouds have important impacts on tropospheric chemistry. Global mean OH concentration increases by about 20\% due to the impact of clouds. As a result, the calculated CH4 lifetime changes to 11 years for clear sky and 9 years for cloudy sky. The latter value is closer to the methane lifetime estimated from previous studies. Calculated CO surface concentrations are compared with observed values, showing an improvement when the impact of clouds on the photolysis rates is taken into account. Clouds also have important impacts on tropospheric ozone budget. Our calculation suggest that because of clouds, the globally averaged photolysis rates of J[O-3], J[CH2O], and J[NO2] are enhanced in the troposphere by about 12, 13, and 13\%, respectively, leading to an 8\% increase in the tropospheric O-3 concentrations. Our study suggests that clouds strongly influence photolysis rates and hence play an important role in controlling the concentrations of the tropospheric oxidants. Such effects should be carefully considered and included in regional and global chemical transport models.},

	abstract = {This is the second part of a study that characterizes several bulk properties of ice particle populations sampled in synoptically generated midlatitude and convectively generated tropical ice clouds, for the purpose of developing empirical and analytical relationships that describe microphysical properties for use in mesoscale and climate models. The purpose of this paper is to examine the interrelationships between the mass, area, and fall velocity properties of the particle size distributions, and the dependence of these properties on temperature.Gamma distributions of the form N = N-0 D(mu)e(-lambdaD) are fitted to the measured particle size distributions (PSDs) over sizes (D) from as small as 10 mum to as large as 1.5 cm. Exponential distributions (mu = 0) are also fitted to the PSD. The intercept parameter N-0 and the slope lambda are directly related, and decrease monotonically with increasing temperature. The mu values for the gamma fits tend from positive values at large lambda to negative values at small lambda. The maximum measured diameter D-max increases with decreasing lambda. The N-0 values from the midlatitude clouds are about an order of magnitude lower than those for the tropical PSDs at the same temperatures. Bulk properties are derived from the fitted PSDs. The ice water contents (IWC) are about an order of magnitude higher for the tropical than for the midlatitude clouds. The median mass diameter (D-m) and the effective diameter (D-e) each increase with temperature, and are found to be related to each other.Several aspects related to the modeling of ice particle sedimentation in general circulation models (GCMs), and the relationship of these velocities to other bulk properties, are investigated. On average, the median mass-weighted terminal velocity (V-m) increases weakly with temperature. Correlations between V-m and IWC are also weak. It is found that for a given particle ensemble, most of the ice mass is contained within a relatively narrow range of fall velocities, although the values of V-m can be appreciable. Calculations reveal that the fallout of particles that dominate the extinction cannot be ignored, except at temperatures below -50degreesC. Also, the effective diameter is found to be strongly related to the ensemble mean V-m, perhaps allowing the two variables to be linked in GCMs.},

The largest and most significant trends are observed during the "active season" for stratospheric planetary wave-mean flow interaction, January-March (JFM), when fluctuations in the AO amplify with height into the lower stratosphere. For the periods of record considered, virtually all of the JFM geopotential height falls over the polar cap region and the strengthening of the subpolar westerlies from the surface to the lower stratosphere, similar to 50\% of the JFM warming over the Eurasian continent, similar to 30\% of the JFM warming over the NH as a whole, similar to 40\% of the JFM stratospheric cooling over the polar cap region, and similar to 40\% of the March total column ozone losses poleward of 40 degrees N are linearly congruent with month-to-month variations in the AO index. Summertime sea level pressure falls over the Arctic basin are suggestive of a year-round drift toward the positive polarity of the AO, but the evidence is less conclusive. Owing to the photochemical memory inherent in the ozone distribution, roughly half the ozone depletion during the NH summer months is linearly dependent on AO-related ozone lasses incurred during the previous active season.Lower-tropospheric geopotential height falls over the Antarctic polar cap region are indicative of a drift toward the high index polarity of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode with no apparent seasonality. In contrast, the trend toward a cooling and strengthening of the SH stratospheric polar vortex peaks sharply during the stratosphere's relatively short active season centered in November. The most pronounced SE ozone losses have occurred in September-October, one or two months prior to this active season. In both hemispheres, positive feedbacks involving ozone destruction, cooling, and a weakening of the wave-driven meridional circulation may be contributing to a delayed breakdown of the polar vortex and enhanced ozone losses during spring.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of modeled radiative fluxes to the specification of cloud microphysical parameterizations of effective radius and fallout are investigated using a single-column model and measurements from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. The single-column model was run with data for the 3-month period of June - August 2000 at the ARM Southern Great Plains site forced with operational numerical weather prediction data. Several different packages of cloud microphysical parameterizations were used in the single-column model. The temporal evolution of modeled cloud amount as well as surface radiative fluxes from a control run compare well with ARM measurements.Mean ice particle fall speeds varied significantly with respect to the assumed ice particle habit. As particle fall speeds increased, the overall cloud fraction, cloud height, and grid-averaged ice water path decreased. The outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) differs by up to 4 W m(-2) over the range of fall speeds examined, while shortwave fluxes varied little as most of the changes in cloud properties occurred at times of minimal solar radiation.Model results indicate that surface and top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes are sensitive to the scheme used to specify the ice particle effective radius. On the seasonal timescale this sensitivity is on the order of 4 W m(-2) and on the daily timescale can be as large as 32 W m(-2). A conclusive statement as to which microphysical scheme is performing best is not achievable until cloud microphysical measurements include an accurate representation of small ice particles. The modeled variance of the ice particle effective radius at any given height in the model is considerably smaller than that suggested by measurements. Model results indicate that this underestimation of the ice particle effective radius variance can alter the seasonal mean top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes by up to 5 W m(-2) and the mean longwave cooling rate by up to 0.2degrees K day(-1) near the location of maximum cloud amount.These seemingly modest flux sensitivities may have important implications for numerical climate simulations. These numerical experiments and observational comparisons have provided valuable physical insight into ice cloud - radiation physics and also into the mechanisms through which contemporary cloud microphysical parameterizations interact with climate model radiation schemes. In particular, the results demonstrate the importance of the smaller ice particles and emphasize the critical role played by not only the average particle size and shape but also the width of the ice particle effective radius distribution about its mean. In fact, the results show that this variability in particle size can sometimes play a greater role in cloud - radiation interactions than the more obvious variations in cloud amount due to changes in ice particle fall speed.},

The possibility of water vapor transport from the troposphere to the stratosphere by deep convection is investigated using three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic, quasi-compressible simulations of a Midwest severe thunderstorm. The results show that the breaking of gravity waves at the cloud top can cause cloud water vapor to be injected into the stratosphere in the form of plumes above a thunderstorm anvil. Meteorological satellites and aircrafts have observed such plumes previously, but the source of water vapor and the injection mechanism were not identified. The present results reveal that there are two types of plumes, anvil sheet plumes and overshooting plumes, in this injection process and that the process is diabatic. A first-order estimate of this plume transport of water vapor per day from the upper troposphere to the lower stratosphere was made assuming that all thunderstorms behave the same as the one simulated. Other trace chemicals may also be similarly transported by the same mechanism.},

It is also shown that thin high cloud, which has a positive net radiative effect on the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy balance, is nearly twice as abundant in the west Pacific compared to the east Pacific. For a given rain rate, anvil cloud is also more abundant in the west Pacific. The ensemble of all high clouds in the east Pacific induces considerably more TOA radiative cooling compared to the west Pacific, primarily because of more high, thin cloud in the west Pacific. High clouds are also systematically colder in the west Pacific by about 5 K.The authors examine whether the anvil cloud temperature is better predicted by low-level equivalent potential temperature (Theta(E)), or by the peak in upper-level convergence associated with radiative cooling in clear skies. The temperature in the upper troposphere where Theta(E) is the same as that at the lifting condensation level (LCL) seems to influence the temperatures of the coldest, thickest clouds, but has no simple relation to anvil cloud. It is shown instead that a linear relationship exists between the median anvil cloud-top temperature and the temperature at the peak in clear-sky convergence. The radiatively driven clear-sky convergence profiles are thus consistent with the warmer anvil clouds in the EP versus the WP.},

	abstract = {The net effect of clouds on the energy balance at the top of the atmosphere is investigated using data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. A regional analysis is made of the relative magnitudes of the effects of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation and on reflected solar radiation. The ratio of these two effects is expressed in terms of a cloud factor angle defined in coordinates of reflected solar versus outgoing longwave radiation. This parameter is a measure of the net radiative effectiveness of clouds, which is insensitive to the average amount of cloud present. It is calculated in two independent ways. One method uses monthly averaged clear-sky and average values, and the other uses regression between daily values of solar and longwave exitance. Because the effect of cloud amount variations is minimized by the analysis procedure used here, the spatial pattern of cloud radiative effectiveness is simpler than that of cloud radiative forcing and corresponds to the pattern of circulation and cloud type regimes. The two methods of estimating the effectiveness give essentially the same spatial pattern. Both estimates of the cloud radiative effectiveness indicate that the global average net radiative effect of today's clouds is cooling, with the decrease in absorbed solar greater than the decrease in outgoing longwave radiation. The ratio of the solar to the longwave effect of cloud is about 1.85 based on the regression method and 1.55 based on the comparison of clear-sky and average radiation budget climatologies. The differences between the two methods arise primarily from regions of stratus cloud, tropical cumulonimbus cloud and clouds over snow. In each of these regions the regression method indicates a more strongly cooling effect. The difference between the global mean estimates is within their uncertainty. Investigation of the areas of disagreement between the two methods reveals remaining problems. Significant improvement in our understanding of the effect of clouds on the radiation balance will require that the analysis procedure incorporate simultaneous measurements of temperature, humidity, and cloud structure, with particular importance attached to humidity in the deep tropics and temperature over land surfaces. Additional spectral information will be necessary to discriminate the role of clouds over snow and ice.},

Eventually, perhaps, a great deal: the overall climate response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may prove much simpler and more predictable than the chaos of short-term weather. Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

	abstract = {Of great importance for the simulation of climate using general circulation models is their ability to represent accurately the vertical distribution of fractional cloud amount. In this paper, a technique to derive cloud fraction as a function of height using ground-based radar and lidar is described. The relatively unattenuated radar detects clouds and precipitation throughout the whole depth of the troposphere, whereas the lidar is able to locate cloud base accurately in the presence of rain or drizzle. From a direct comparison of 3 months of cloud fraction observed at Chilbolton, England, with the values held at the nearest grid box of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) model it is found that, on average, the model tends to underpredict cloud fraction below 7 km and considerably overpredict it above. The difference below 7 km can in large part be explained by the fact that the model treats snow and ice cloud separately, with snow not contributing to cloud fraction. Modifying the model cloud fraction to include the contribution from snow (already present in the form of fluxes between levels) results in much better agreement in mean cloud fraction, frequency of occurrence, and amount when present between 1 and 7 km. This, together with the fact that both the lidar and the radar echoes tend to be stronger in the regions of ice clouds that the model regards as snow, indicates that snow should not be treated as radiatively inert by the model radiation scheme. Above 7 km, the difference between the model and the observations is partly due to some of the high clouds in the model being associated with very low values of ice water content that one would not expect the radar to detect. However, removal of these from the model still leaves an apparent overestimate of cloud fraction by up to a factor of 2. A tendency in the lowest kilometer for the model to simulate cloud features up to 3 h before they are observed is also found. Overall, this study demonstrates the considerable potential of active instruments for validating the representation of clouds in models.},

As a result, the climatic effect of the aerosol remains controversial. We propose that the difficulty in untangling relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflects the inadequacy of existing tools and methodologies and a failure to account for processes that buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations.},

	abstract = {Cloud phase recognition is important for cloud studies. Ice crystals correspond to physical process and properties that differ from those of liquid water drops. The angular polarization signature is a good mean to discriminate between spherical and nonspherical particles (liquid and ice phase, respectively). POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances) has been launched on the Japanese ADEOS platform in August 1996. Because of its multidirectional, multispectral, and multipolarization capabilities this new radiometer gives useful information on clouds and their influence on radiation in the shortwave range. The POLDER bidirectional observation capability provides the polarization signatures within a large range of scattering angles in three spectral bands centered on 0.443, 0.670, and 0.865 mu m with a spatial resolution of 6.2 km x 6.2 km. These original features allow to obtain some information both on cloud thermodynamic phase and on cloud microphysics (size/shape). According to POLDER airborne observations, liquid cloud droplets exhibit very specific polarization features of a rainbow for scattering angles near 140 degrees. Conversely, theoretical studies of scattering, by various crystalline particles and also airborne measurements show that the rainbow characteristics disappear as soon as the particles depart from the spherical shape. In the paper the POLDER algorithm for cloud phase classification is presented, as well as the physical principle of this algorithm. Results derived from the POLDER spaceborne version are also presented and compared with lidar ground-based observations and satellite cloud classification. This cloud phase classification method is shown to be reliable. The major limitation appears when thin cirrus clouds overlap the liquid cloud layer, In this case, if the cirrus optical thickness is smaller than 2, the liquid phase may be retrieved. Otherwise, the ice phase is correctly detected as long as cloud detection works.},

	abstract = {Why does Zipf's law give a good description of data from seemingly completely unrelated phenomena? Here it is argued that the reason is that they can all be described as outcomes of a ubiquitous random group division: the elements can be citizens of a country and the groups family names, or the elements can be all the words making up a novel and the groups the unique words, or the elements could be inhabitants and the groups the cities in a country and so on. A random group formation (RGF) is presented from which a Bayesian estimate is obtained based on minimal information: it provides the best prediction for the number of groups with k elements, given the total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. For each specification of these three values, the RGF predicts a unique group distribution N(k) proportional to exp(-bk)/k(gamma), where the power-law index gamma is a unique function of the same three values. The universality of the result is made possible by the fact that no system-specific assumptions are made about the mechanism responsible for the group division. The direct relation between gamma and the total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group is calculated. The predictive power of the RGF model is demonstrated by direct comparison with data from a variety of systems. It is shown that gamma usually takes values in the interval 1 {\textless}= gamma {\textless}= 2 and that the value for a given phenomenon depends in a systematic way on the total size of the dataset. The results are put in the context of earlier discussions on Zipf's and Gibrat's laws, N(k) proportional to k(-2) and the connection between growth models and RGF is elucidated.},

HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1degrees latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5degrees latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.},

	abstract = {Satellite-based estimates of the aerosol indirect effect (AIE) are consistently smaller than the estimates from global aerosol models, and, partly as a result of these differences, the assessment of this climate forcing includes large uncertainties. Satellite estimates typically use the present-day (PD) relationship between observed cloud drop number concentrations (N-c) and aerosol optical depths (AODs) to determine the preindustrial (PI) values of N-c. These values are then used to determine the PD and PI cloud albedos and, thus, the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on top of the atmosphere radiative fluxes. Here, we use a model with realistic aerosol and cloud processes to show that empirical relationships for In (N-c) versus In (AOD) derived from PD results do not represent the atmospheric perturbation caused by the addition of anthropogenic aerosols to the preindustrial atmosphere. As a result, the model estimates based on satellite methods of the AIE are between a factor of 3 to more than a factor of 6 smaller than model estimates based on actual PD and PI values for N-c. Using In(N-c) versus In(AI) (Aerosol Index, or the optical depth times angstrom exponent) to estimate preindustrial values for N-c provides estimates for N-c and forcing that are closer to the values predicted by the model. Nevertheless, the AIE using In(N-c) versus In(AI) may be substantially incorrect on a regional basis and may underestimate or overestimate the global average forcing by 25 to 35\%.},

	abstract = {The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or "annular" structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45 degrees latitude. The structure and dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have been extensively documented, whereas the existence of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind fields. In this paper the; structure and seasonality of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and supplementary datasets.The structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields, but in the mean meridional circulations as well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but they amplify with height upward into the stratosphere during those seasons in which the strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong planetary wave-mean how interaction: midwinter in the NH and late spring in the SH. During these "active seasons," the annular modes modulate the strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the lower stratosphere, total column ozone and tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and the strength of the trade winds of their respective hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded planetary wave signature with expressions in surface air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone, and tropopause height. It is argued that the horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere is instrumental in forcing this pattern.A companion paper documents the striking resemblance between the structure of the annular modes and observed climate trends over the past few decades.},

Simulations were carried out with the NASA Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) atmospheric and transport model using climatological metereorological fields derived from the former NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO), the NASA Finite volume GCM (FVGCM) and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies version II' (GISS) GCM. Cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is calculated using a physically based prognostic parameterization that explicitly includes entrainment effects on droplet formation. Diabatic activation results in lower CDNC, compared to adiabatic treatment of the process. The largest decrease in CDNC (by up to 75\%) was found in the tropics and in zones of moderate CCN concentration. This leads to a global mean effective radius increase between 0.2-0.5 mu m (up to 3.5 mu m over the tropics), a global mean autoconversion rate increase by a factor of 1.1 to 1.7 (up to a factor of 4 in the tropics), and a 0.2-0.4 W m(-2) decrease in indirect forcing. The spatial patterns of entrainment effects on droplet activation tend to reduce biases in effective radius (particularly in the tropics) when compared to satellite retrievals. Considering the diabatic nature of ambient clouds, entrainment effects on CDNC need to be considered in GCM studies of the aerosol indirect effect.},

	abstract = {Heavy smoke from forest. res in the Amazon was observed to reduce cloud droplet size and so delay the onset of precipitation from 1.5 kilometers above cloud base in pristine clouds to more than 5 kilometers in polluted clouds and more than 7 kilometers in pyro-clouds. Suppression of low-level rainout and aerosol washout allows transport of water and smoke to upper levels, where the clouds appear "smoking" as they detrain much of the pollution. Elevating the onset of precipitation allows invigoration of the updrafts, causing intense thunderstorms, large hail, and greater likelihood for overshooting cloud tops into the stratosphere. There, detrained pollutants and water vapor would have profound radiative impacts on the climate system. The invigorated storms release the latent heat higher in the atmosphere. This should substantially affect the regional and global circulation systems. Together, these processes affect the water cycle, the pollution burden of the atmosphere, and the dynamics of atmospheric circulation.},

	abstract = {Detecting extreme events in large datasets is a major challenge in climate science research. Current algorithms for extreme event detection are build upon human expertise in defining events based on subjective thresholds of relevant physical variables. Often, multiple competing methods produce vastly different results on the same dataset. Accurate characterization of extreme events in climate simulations and observational data archives is critical for understanding the trends and potential impacts of such events in a climate change content. This study presents the first application of Deep Learning techniques as alternative methodology for climate extreme events detection. Deep neural networks are able to learn high-level representations of a broad class of patterns from labeled data. In this work, we developed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification system and demonstrated the usefulness of Deep Learning technique for tackling climate pattern detection problems. Coupled with Bayesian based hyper-parameter optimization scheme, our deep CNN system achieves 89\%-99\% of accuracy in detecting extreme events (Tropical Cyclones, Atmospheric Rivers and Weather Fronts},

	abstract = {Riming electrification was studied in cold room experiments simulating thunderstorm conditions. When both ice crystals and supercooled droplets coexist in the experimental chamber, high electric charge occurs on the riming probes. Both the sign and magnitude of riming electrification are highly dependent on the temperature and cloud water content.Electric charge of the order of 104 esu (33 fC) is separated on riming with each ice crystal collision under conditions typical of the in-cloud environment of continental thunderstorms. This amount of charge is sufficient to produce the high electrification required for lightning discharge within reasonably short periods of time.The effect of the electrical field on charge separation during the riming and effect of the freezing potential of drops of rime also were examined. It appears that these effects play only a secondary role for charge separation in thunderstorms.Three different physical mechanisms of charge separation during riming are proposed and discussed to explain the riming charge under different conditions of temperature and cloud water content. Possible differences in the character of thunderstorms at various geographical locations are briefly considered.},

In the evolution of CAM from version 4 to version 5, the water vapor, temperature, surface albedo, and lapse rate feedbacks are remarkably stable across changes to the physical parameterization suite. However, the climate sensitivity increases from 3.2 K in CAM4 to 4.0 K in CAM5. The difference is mostly due to (i) more positive cloud feedbacks and (ii) higher CO2 radiative forcing in CAM5. The intermodel differences in cloud feedbacks are largest in the tropical trade cumulus regime and in the midlatitude storm tracks. The subtropical stratocumulus regions do not contribute strongly to climate feedbacks owing to their small area coverage. A “modified Cess” configuration for atmosphere-only model experime...},

	doi = {10.5194/acp-15-7351-2015},
	abstract = {The two-way transition between closed and open cellular convection is addressed in an idealized cloud-resolving modeling framework. A series of cloud-resolving simulations shows that the transition between closed and open cellular states is asymmetrical and characterized by a rapid ("runaway") transition from the closed- to the open-cell state but slower recovery to the closed-cell state. Given that precipitation initiates the closed-open cell transition and that the recovery requires a suppression of the precipitation, we apply an ad hoc time-varying drop concentration to initiate and suppress precipitation. We show that the asymmetry in the two-way transition occurs even for very rapid drop concentration replenishment. The primary barrier to recovery is the loss in turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) associated with the loss in cloud water (and associated radiative cooling) and the vertical stratification of the boundary layer during the open-cell period. In transitioning from the open to the closed state, the system faces the task of replenishing cloud water fast enough to counter precipitation losses, such that it can generate radiative cooling and TKE. It is hampered by a stable layer below cloud base that has to be overcome before water vapor can be transported more efficiently into the cloud layer. Recovery to the closed-cell state is slower when radiative cooling is inefficient such as in the presence of free tropospheric clouds or after sunrise, when it is hampered by the absorption of shortwave radiation. Tests suggest that recovery to the closed-cell state is faster when the drizzle is smaller in amount and of shorter duration, i.e., when the precipitation causes less boundary layer stratification. Cloud-resolving model results on recovery rates are supported by simulations with a simple predator-prey dynamical system analogue. It is suggested that the observed closing of open cells by ship effluent likely occurs when aerosol intrusions are large, when contact comes prior to the heaviest drizzle in the early morning hours, and when the free troposphere is cloud free.},

Characterizing both the spatiotemporal variability and the fidelity of these exchanges of heat and moisture is critical to understanding the global water and energy cycle variations, quantifying atmosphere–ocean feedbacks, and improving model predictability. This study examines the veracity of the recently completed NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) product in terms of its turbulent surface fluxes. This assessment employs a large dataset of directly measured turbulent fluxes as well as other turbulent surface flux datasets. The spatial and temporal variability of the surface fluxes are examined in terms of their annual-mean climatologies, their seasonal covariability of near-surface bulk parameters, and their representation of extremes. The impact of data assimilation on the near-surface parameters is assessed thr...},

The simulated vertical structure of the temperature and humidity are compared with twice-daily radiosonde observations at two stations. Generally the trade wind inversion (TWI) height and occurrence days are well represented. The simulation over the islands is compared with observations from nine surface climatological stations and a dense network of precipitation stations.

One winter of GISS general circulation model simulations of Northern and Southern Hemisphere warm and cold fronts at 2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ × 2.5$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ × 32 levels resolution gives similar cloud distributions but with much lowe...},

	abstract = {A new modeling framework is used to investigate aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions and dynamical feedbacks at the mesoscale. The focus is on simulation of the formation and evolution of cellular structures that are commonly seen in satellite images of marine stratocumulus clouds. Simulations are performed at moderate resolution in a 60 x 60 km(2) domain for 16 h to adequately represent the mesoscale organization associated with open cells and precipitation. Results support the emerging understanding that precipitation plays a critical role in the formation and evolution of open cells. Evaporation of raindrops generates a dynamic response that manifests itself in cellular organization of updrafts and downdrafts and promotes and sustains the formation of an open cellular structure in cloud fields. Vertical motion in open-cell centers with thin clouds is minimal. It is shown that a mean surface rain rate as low as 0.02 mm day(-1) is, for the case considered, sufficient to promote the formation of open cells. The maximum dimension of individual open cells ranges between 5 and 30 km. Individual cells grow at a mean rate of between 5 and 10 km h(-1). Irregularity in the shape of open cells is caused by formation of new precipitating regions at the cell walls and interference with neighboring cells, which erode, and eventually eliminate, the old cells. The typical lifetime of large individual open cells is about 2 h, close to that observed by radar, although a collection of open cells as a whole may last for tens of hours.},

Taking full advantage of the MODIS multiple channels, the method can differentiate cirrus overlapping lower water clouds from single-layer clouds. Based on newly retrieved cloud products using daytime Terra/MODIS 5-km overcast measurements sampled in January, April, July, and October 2001, global statistics of the frequency of occurrence, cloud-top pressure/temperature (Pc/Tc), visible optical depth (τVIS), and infrared emissivity (ε) are presented and discussed.

The first algorithm utilizes data in the 0.65-, 11-, and 12-μm regions of the spectrum that are available on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The second algorithm incorporates two different techniques to detect cloud overlap: the same technique used in the first algorithm and an additional series of spectral tests that now include data from the 1.38- and 1.65-μm near-infrared regions that are available on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and will be available on the Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). VIIRS is the imager that will replace the AVHRR on the next generation of polar-orbiting satellites. Both algorithms were derived assuming that a scene with cloud overlap consists of a semitransparent ice cloud that overlaps a cloud composed of liquid water droplets. Each algorithm was tested on three different MODIS scenes. In all three cases, the second (VIIRS) algorithm was able to detect more cloud overlap than the first (AVHRR) algorithm. Radiative transfer calculations indicate that the VIIRS algorithm will be more effective than the AVHRR algorithm when the visible optical depth of the ice cloud is greater than 3. Both algorithms will work best when the visible optical depth of the water cloud is greater than 5. Model sensitivity studies were also performed to assess the sensitivity of each algorithm to various parameters. It was found that the AVHRR algorithm is most sensitive to cloud particle size and the VIIRS near-infrared test is most sensitive to cloud vertical location. When validating each algorithm using cloud radar data, the VIIRS algorithm was shown to be more effective at detecting cloud overlap than the AVHRR algorithm; however, the VIIRS algorithm was slightly more prone to false cloud overlap detection.{\textless}HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="30\%"{\textgreater}},

Using thunderstorm occurrence and precipitation observations for the period 1948–77, along with automated lightning strike data for the period 1986–96, it was possible to classify convective days as either “dry” or “wet” for several stations in the Pacific Northwest. Based on the classification, a discriminant analysis was performed on coincident upper-air sounding data from Spokane, Washington. It was found that a discriminant rule using the dewpoint depression at 85 kPa and the temperature difference between 85 and 50 kPa was able to classify correctly between 56\% and 80\% of the convective days as dry or wet. Also, composite maps of upper-air data showed distinctly different synoptic patterns among dry days, wet days, and all days. These findings potentially can be used by resource managers to gain a greater understanding of the atm...},

	abstract = {The recently introduced panoptic segmentation task has renewed our community's interest in unifying the tasks of instance segmentation (for thing classes) and semantic segmentation (for stuff classes). However, current state-of-the-art methods for this joint task use separate and dissimilar networks for instance and semantic segmentation, without performing any shared computation. In this work, we aim to unify these methods at the architectural level, designing a single network for both tasks. Our approach is to endow Mask R-CNN, a popular instance segmentation method, with a semantic segmentation branch using a shared Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone. Surprisingly, this simple baseline not only remains effective for instance segmentation, but also yields a lightweight, top-performing method for semantic segmentation. In this work, we perform a detailed study of this minimally extended version of Mask R-CNN with FPN, which we refer to as Panoptic FPN, and show it is a robust and accurate baseline for both tasks. Given its effectiveness and conceptual simplicity, we hope our method can serve as a strong baseline and aid future research in panoptic segmentation.},

of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the
training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G

with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled
approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The exhaust is a source of cloud-condensation nuclei that increases the number of cloud droplets while reducing droplet size. This reduction in droplet size causes the reflectivity at 3.7 micrometers to be greater than the levels for nearby noncontaminated clouds of similar physical characteristics. The increase in droplet number causes the reflectivity at 0.63 micrometer to be significantly higher for the contaminated clouds despite the likelihood that the exhaust is a source of particles that absorb at visible wavelengths. The effect of aerosols on cloud reflectivity is expected to have a larger influence on the earth's albedo than that due to the direct scattering and absorption of sunlight by the aerosols alone.},

General circulation models (GCMs) are the tool for predicting future climate, but the treatment of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol−cloud radiative effects carries large uncertainties that directly affect GCM predictions, such as climate sensitivity. Predictions are hampered by the large range of scales of interaction between various components that need to be captured. Observation systems (remote sensing, in situ) are increasingly being used to constrain predictions, but significant challenges exist, to some extent because of the large range of scales and the fact that the various measuring systems tend to address different scales. Fine-scale models represent clouds, aerosols, and aerosol−cloud interactions with high fidelity but do not include interactions with the larger scale and are therefore limited from a climatic point of view. We suggest strategies for improving estimates of aerosol−cloud relationships in climate models, for new remote sensing and in situ measurements, and for quantifying and reducing model uncertainty.},

Aerosol and cloud properties were measured onboard the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter aircraft. One cloud that was clearly impacted by ship emissions as well as the ensemble of clouds observed over the entire mission are analyzed in detail. Results at both the individual and ensemble scales clearly confirm the Twomey effect (first indirect effect of aerosols) and demonstrate drizzle suppression at elevated aerosol number concentration. For the ship track impacted cloud, suppressed drizzle in the track led to a larger cloud liquid water path (LWP) at the same cloud thickness, in accord with the so-called second indirect effect. Ensemble averages over all clouds sampled over the entire 13-flight mission show the opposite effect of aerosol number concentration on LWP, presumably the result of other dynamic influences (e.g., updraft velocity and ambient sounding profile). Individual polluted clouds were found to exhibit a narrower cloud drop spectral width in accord with theoretical prediction (M.-L. Lu and J. H. Seinfeld, Effect of aerosol number concentration on cloud droplet dispersion: A large-eddy simulation study and implications for aerosol indirect forcing, Journal of Geophysical Research, 2006). This field experiment demonstrates both the indirect aerosol effect on ship track perturbed clouds, as well as the subtleties involved in extracting these effects over an ensemble of clouds sampled over a 1-month period.},

The underlying causes of this uncertainty among modeled predictions of climate are the gaps in our fundamental understanding of cloud processes. There has been significant progress with both observations and models in addressing these important questions but quantifying them correctly is nontrivial, thus limiting our ability to represent them in global climate models. The Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment (E-PEACE) 2011 was a targeted aircraft campaign with embedded modeling studies, using the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter aircraft and the research vessel Point Sur in July and August 2011 off the central coast of California, with a full payload of instruments to measure particle and cloud number, mass, composition, and water uptake distributions. EPEACE used three emitted particle sources to separate particle-induced feedbacks from dynamical variability, namely 1) shipboard smoke-generated particles with 0.05–1-μm diameters (which produced tracks measured by satellite and had drop composition characteristic of organic smoke), 2) combustion particles from container ships with 0.05–0.2-μm diameters (which were measured in a variety of conditions with droplets containing both organic and sulfate components), and 3) aircraft-based milled salt particles with 3–5-μm diameters (which showed enhanced drizzle rates in some clouds). The aircraft observations were consistent with past large-eddy simulations of deeper clouds in ship tracks and aerosol– cloud parcel modeling of cloud drop number and composition, providing quantitative constraints on aerosol effects on warm-cloud microphysics.},

The efficacy of this as a strategy for global cooling rests on the extent to which aerosol-perturbed marine clouds will respond with increased albedo. Ship tracks, quasi-linear cloud features prevalent in oceanic regions impacted by ship exhaust, are a well-known manifestation of the effect of aerosol injection on marine clouds. We present here an analysis of the albedo responses in ship tracks, based on in situ aircraft measurements and three years of satellite observations of 589 individual ship tracks. It is found that the sign (increase or decrease) and magnitude of the albedo response in ship tracks depends on the mesoscale cloud structure, the free tropospheric humidity, and cloud top height. In a closed cell structure (cloud cells ringed by a perimeter of clear air), nearly 30\% of ship tracks exhibited a decreased albedo. Detailed cloud responses must be accounted for in global studies of the potential efficacy of sea-spray geoengineering as a means to counteract global warming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects suffer from large uncertainty in climate models and among observations. This study focuses on two plausible factors: regime dependence of aerosol-cloud interactions and the effect of cloud droplet spectral shape. We show, using a new parcel model, that combined consideration of droplet number concentration (Nc) and relative dispersion (ε, ratio of standard deviation to mean radius of the cloud droplet size distribution) better characterizes the regime dependence of aerosol-cloud interactions than considering Nc alone. Given updraft velocity (w), ε increases with increasing aerosol number concentration (Na) in the aerosol-limited regime, peaks in the transitional regime, and decreases with further increasing Na in the updraft-limited regime. This new finding further reconciles contrasting observations in literature and reinforces the compensating role of dispersion effect. The nonmonotonic behavior of ε further quantifies the relationship between the transitional Na and w that separates the aerosol- and updraft-limited regimes.},

	abstract = {Three years of 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations for morning (Terra) and afternoon (Aqua) summertime marine stratus off the west coast of the United States were analyzed to determine the response of the clouds to aerosols in the plumes of underlying ships. The polluted clouds were identified in pixels with elevated 2.1-μm reflectivities and 3.7-μm radiances when compared with nearby pixels that contained unpolluted clouds. An automated routine was developed to identify which of the pixels contained clouds polluted by underlying ships and then to select unpolluted control pixels on both sides of the ship track as near as was feasible to the polluted clouds, often with a separation of as little as 1 pixel. While no requirements were placed on the cloud cover fraction within the selected pixels, to facilitate comparisons with an earlier study based on 1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery, the results presented here are restricted to 20-pixel segments along the ship tracks in which all of the pixels identified as polluted and all of the pixels selected as controls on both sides of the tracks were found to be overcast. The pollution caused about a 20\% reduction in droplet radius in both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. In the MODIS observations, the increase in optical depth was about 15\% and statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 99.5\%. These changes were much larger than the 2\% and statistically negligible increases found for the AVHRR observations. Like the AVHRR observations, the MODIS observations indicated that the majority of clouds (60\%) lost liquid water when polluted, but consistent with the different outcomes for the optical depths, the losses for the MODIS observations were about half the nearly 20\% loss found in the AVHRR observations. Cloud altitudes were unaffected by the pollution for both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. For both morning and afternoon clouds, those with the largest increases in albedo in response to the pollution also showed the largest increases in cloud liquid water amount. The changes in droplet radii and liquid water amounts retrieved using the MODIS observations suggested that droplet growth was suppressed in the polluted clouds and that the rate of growth from cloud base to cloud top was also reduced when compared with nearby unpolluted clouds.},

This method is based on a fast radiative transfer (RT) model and infrared (IR) observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study conducts thorough error and information content analyses to understand the error propagation and performance of retrievals from various MODIS band combinations under different cloud/atmosphere states. Speciﬁcally, the algorithm takes into account four error sources: measurement uncertainty, fast RT model uncertainty, uncertainties in ancillary data sets (e.g., atmospheric state), and assumed ice crystal habit uncertainties. It is found that the ancillary and ice crystal habit error sources dominate the MODIS IR retrieval uncertainty and cannot be ignored. The information content analysis shows that for a given ice cloud, the use of four MODIS IR observations is sufﬁcient to retrieve the three cloud properties. However, the selection of MODIS IR bands that provide the most information and their order of importance varies with both the ice cloud properties and the ambient atmospheric and the surface states. As a result, this study suggests the inclusion of all MODIS IR bands in practice since little a priori information is available.},

The results show that OE-IR cloud optical thickness (τ) and effective radius (reff) retrievals perform best for ice clouds having 0.5 {\textless} τ {\textless} 7 and reff {\textless} 50 µm. For global ice clouds, the averaged retrieval uncertainties of τ and reff are 19\% and 33\%, respectively. For optically thick ice clouds with τ larger than 10, however, the τ and reff retrieval uncertainties can exceed 30\% and 50\%, respectively. For ice cloud top height (h), the averaged global uncertainty is 0.48 km. Relatively large h uncertainty (e.g., {\textgreater} 1 km) occurs for τ {\textless} 0.5. Analysis of 1 month of the OE-IR retrievals shows large τ and reff uncertainties in storm track regions and the southern oceans where convective clouds are frequently observed, as well as in high-latitude regions where temperature differences between the surface and cloud top are more ambiguous. Generally, comparisons between the OE-IR and the operational products show consistent τ and h retrievals. However, obvious differences between the OE-IR and the MODIS Collection 6 reff are found.},

Low-cloud fraction has a strong land-ocean contrast with oceanic values double those over land. Major low-cloud regimes include not only the eastern ocean boundary stratocumulus and shallow cumulus but also those associated with cold air outbreaks downwind of wintertime continents and land stratus over particular geographic areas. Globally, about 30\% of low clouds are overlapped by high clouds. The overlap rate exhibits strong spatial variability ranging from higher than 90\% in the tropics to less than 5\% in subsidence areas and is anticorrelated with subsidence rate and low-cloud fraction. The zonal mean of vertical separation between cloud layers is never smaller than 5 km and its zonal variation closely follows that of tropopause height, implying a tight connection with tropopause dynamics. Possible impacts of cloud overlap on low clouds are discussed.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models over discrete data.

We present an assessment of the contribution of gaseous and particulate emissions from oceangoing shipping to anthropogenic emissions and air quality. We also assess the degradation in human health and climate change created by these emissions. Regulating ship emissions requires comprehensive knowledge of current fuel consumption and emissions, understanding of their impact on atmospheric composition and climate, and projections of potential future evolutions and mitigation options. Nearly 70\% of ship emissions occur within 400 km of coastlines, causing air quality problems through the formation of ground-level ozone, sulphur emissions and particulate matter in coastal areas and harbours with heavy traffic. Furthermore, ozone and aerosol precursor emissions as well as their derivative species from ships may be transported in the atmosphere over several hundreds of kilometres, and thus contribute to air quality problems further inland, even though they are emitted at sea. In addition, ship emissions impact climate. Recent studies indicate that the cooling due to altered clouds far outweighs the warming effects from greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ozone from shipping, overall causing a negative present-day radiative forcing (RF). Current efforts to reduce sulphur and other pollutants from shipping may modify this. However, given the short residence time of sulphate compared to CO2, the climate response from sulphate is of the order decades while that of CO2 is centuries. The climatic trade-off between positive and negative radiative forcing is still a topic of scientific research, but from what is currently known, a simple cancellation of global mean forcing components is potentially inappropriate and a more comprehensive assessment metric is required. The CO2 equivalent emissions using the global temperature change potential (GTP) metric indicate that after 50 years the net global mean effect of current emissions is close to zero through cancellation of warming by CO2 and cooling by sulphate and nitrogen oxides.},

	abstract = {We present hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics informed deep learning framework capable of encoding an important class of physical laws governing fluid motions, namely the Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we seek to leverage the underlying conservation laws (i.e., for mass, momentum, and energy) to infer hidden quantities of interest such as velocity and pressure fields merely from spatio-temporal visualizations of a passive scaler (e.g., dye or smoke), transported in arbitrarily complex domains (e.g., in human arteries or brain aneurysms). Our approach towards solving the aforementioned data assimilation problem is unique as we design an algorithm that is agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. This makes HFM highly flexible in choosing the spatio-temporal domain of interest for data acquisition as well as subsequent training and predictions. Consequently, the predictions made by HFM are among those cases where a pure machine learning strategy or a mere scientific computing approach simply cannot reproduce. The proposed algorithm achieves accurate predictions of the pressure and velocity fields in both two and three dimensional flows for several benchmark problems motivated by real-world applications. Our results demonstrate that this relatively simple methodology can be used in physical and biomedical problems to extract valuable quantitative information (e.g., lift and drag forces or wall shear stresses in arteries) for which direct measurements may not be possible.},

Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to realize it.},

Drawing inspiration from the human capability of picking up the essence of a novel object from a small number of examples and generalizing from there, we seek a few-shot, unsupervised image-to-image translation algorithm that works on previously unseen target classes that are specified, at test time, only by a few example images. Our model achieves this few-shot generation capability by coupling an adversarial training scheme with a novel network design. Through extensive experimental validation and comparisons to several baseline methods on benchmark datasets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

	abstract = {Large scale visual surveillance generates huge volumes of data at a rapid pace, giving rise to massive image repositories. Efficient and reliable access to relevant data in these ever growing databases is a highly challenging task due to the complex nature of surveillance objects. Furthermore, inter-class visual similarity between vehicles requires extraction of fine-grained and highly discriminative features. In recent years, features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in image retrieval. However, these features have been used without regard to their sensitivity to objects of a particular class. In this paper, we propose an object-oriented feature selection mechanism for deep convolutional features from a pre-trained CNN. Convolutional feature maps from a deep layer are selected based on the analysis of their responses to surveillance objects. The selected features serve to represent semantic features of surveillance objects and their parts with minimal influence of the background, effectively eliminating the need for background removal procedure prior to features extraction. Layer-wise mean activations from the selected features maps form the discriminative descriptor for each object. These object-oriented convolutional features (OOCF) are then projected onto low-dimensional hamming space using locality sensitive hashing approaches. The resulting compact binary hash codes allow efficient retrieval within large scale datasets. Results on five challenging datasets reveal that OOCF achieves better precision and recall than the full feature set for objects with varying backgrounds.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02070},
	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been successful in processing data signals that are uniformly sampled in the spatial domain (e.g., images). However, most data signals do not natively exist on a grid, and in the process of being sampled onto a uniform physical grid suffer significant aliasing error and information loss. Moreover, signals can exist in different topological structures as, for example, points, lines, surfaces and volumes. It has been challenging to analyze signals with mixed topologies (for example, point cloud with surface mesh). To this end, we develop mathematical formulations for Non-Uniform Fourier Transforms (NUFT) to directly, and optimally, sample nonuniform data signals of different topologies defined on a simplex mesh into the spectral domain with no spatial sampling error. The spectral transform is performed in the Euclidean space, which removes the translation ambiguity from works on the graph spectrum. Our representation has four distinct advantages: (1) the process causes no spatial sampling error during the initial sampling, (2) the generality of this approach provides a unified framework for using CNNs to analyze signals of mixed topologies, (3) it allows us to leverage state-of-the-art backbone CNN architectures for effective learning without having to design a particular architecture for a particular data structure in an ad-hoc fashion, and (4) the representation allows weighted meshes where each element has a different weight (i.e., texture) indicating local properties. We achieve results on par with the state-of-the-art for the 3D shape retrieval task, and a new state-of-the-art for the point cloud to surface reconstruction task.},

	abstract = {A review of the cumulus parameterization problem is presented with an emphasis on its conceptual aspects covering the history of the underlying ideas, major problems existing at present, and possible directions and approaches for future climate models. Since its introduction in the early 1960s, there have been decades of controversies in posing the cumulus parameterization problem. In this paper, it is suggested that confusion between budget and advection considerations is primarily responsible for the controversies. It is also pointed out that the performance of parameterization schemes can be better understood if one is not bound by their authors' justifications. The current trend in posing cumulus parameterization is away from deterministic diagnostic closures, including instantaneous adjustments, toward prognostic or nondeterministic closures, including relaxed and/or triggered adjustments. A number of questions need to be answered, however, for the merit of this trend to be fully utilized. Major practical and conceptual problems in the conventional approach of cumulus parameterization, which include artificial separations of processes and scales, are then discussed. It is rather obvious that for future climate models the scope of the problem must be drastically expanded from “cumulus parameterization” to “unified cloud parameterization,” or even to “unified model physics.” This is an extremely challenging task, both intellectually and computationally, and the use of multiple approaches is crucial even for a moderate success. “Cloud-resolving convective parameterization” or “superparameterization” is a promising new approach that can develop into a multiscale modeling framework (MMF). It is emphasized that the use of such a framework can unify our currently diversified modeling efforts and make verification of climate models against observations much more constructive than it is now.},

Most models, however, have deficiencies and biases that raise large uncertainties in their products. Over the past several decades, a tremendous effort has been made to improve model performance in the simulation of special regions and aspects of the climate system2,3,4. Here we show that biases or errors in special regions can be linked with others at far away locations. We find in 22 climate models that regional sea surface temperature (SST) biases are commonly linked with the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is characterized by the northward flow in the upper ocean and returning southward flow in the deep ocean. A simulated weak AMOC is associated with cold biases in the entire Northern Hemisphere with an atmospheric pattern that resembles the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The AMOC weakening is also associated with a strengthening of Antarctic Bottom Water formation and warm SST biases in the Southern Ocean. It is also shown that cold biases in the tropical North Atlantic and West African/Indian monsoon regions during the warm season in the Northern Hemisphere have interhemispheric links with warm SST biases in the tropical southeastern Pacific and Atlantic, respectively. The results suggest that improving the simulation of regional processes may not suffice for overall better model performance, as the effects of remote biases may override them.},

Recently, a cloud-resolving model (CRM) was embedded into each grid column of a realistic GCM, the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), to serve as a superparameterization (SP) of clouds. Results of the standard CAM and the SP-CAM are contrasted, both using T42 resolution (2.8° × 2.8° grid), 26 vertical levels, and up to a 500-day-long simulation. The SP was based on a two-dimensional (2D) CRM with 64 grid columns and 24 levels collocated with the 24 lowest levels of CAM. In terms of the mean state, the SP-CAM produces quite reasonable geographical distributions of precipitation, precipitable water, top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes, cloud radiative forcing, and high-cloud fraction for both December–January–February and June–July–August. The most notable and persistent precipitation bias in the western Pacific, during the Northern Hemisphere summer of all the SP-CAM runs with 2D SP, seems to go away through the use of a small-domain three-dimensional (3D) SP with the same number of grid columns as the 2D SP, but arranged in an 8 × 8 square with identical horizontal resolution of 4 km. Two runs with the 3D SP have been carried out, with and without explicit large-scale momentum transport by convection. Interestingly, the double ITCZ feature seems to go away in the run that includes momentum transport. The SP improves the diurnal variability of nondrizzle precipitation frequency over the standard model by precipitating most frequently during late afternoon hours over the land, as observed, while the standard model maximizes its precipitation frequency around local solar noon. Over the ocean, both models precipitate most frequently in the early morning hours as observed. The SP model also reproduces the observed global distribution of the percentage of days with nondrizzle precipitation rather well. In contrast, the standard model tends to precipitate more frequently, on average by about 20\%–30\%. The SP model seems to improve the convective intraseasonal variability over the standard model. Preliminary results suggest that the SP produces more realistic variability of such fields as 200-mb wind and OLR, relative to the control, including the often poorly simulated Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO).},

Despite the best efforts of the community, the problem has resisted solution for several decades. The reasons for this are briefly reviewed and it is argued that it will be many more decades before the problem can be solved through the approaches to cloud parameterization that have been used up to now. An alternative approach, called superparameterization, is then outlined, in which high-resolution cloud system-resolving models (CSRMs) are used in place of the conventional cloud parameterizations. Tests performed with the Community Atmosphere Model show that superparameterizations can give more realistic simulations of the current climate, including greatly improved simulations of the Madden–Julian oscillation and other tropical wave disturbances. Superparameterizations increase the cost of climate simulation by a factor of several hundred dollars, but can make efficient use of massively parallel computers. In addition, superparameterizations make it possible for a climate model to converge to a global CSRM as the horizontal grid spacing of the climate model decreases to a few kilometers. No existing global atmospheric model has this convergence property. Superparameterizations have the potential to greatly increase the reliability of climate change simulations.},

Many of the biases present with parameterized convection are strongly reduced when convection is explicitly resolved (i.e., in cloud resolving models at high spatial resolution approximately a kilometer or so). We here present a novel approach to convective parameterization based on machine learning, using an aquaplanet with prescribed sea surface temperatures as a proof of concept. A deep neural network is trained with a superparameterized version of a climate model in which convection is resolved by thousands of embedded 2-D cloud resolving models. The machine learning representation of convection, which we call the Cloud Brain (CBRAIN), can skillfully predict many of the convective heating, moistening, and radiative features of superparameterization that are most important to climate simulation, although an unintended side effect is to reduce some of the superparameterization's inherent variance. Since as few as three months' high-frequency global training data prove sufficient to provide this skill, the approach presented here opens up a new possibility for a future class of convection parameterizations in climate models that are built “top-down,” that is, by learning salient features of convection from unusually explicit simulations.},

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

	abstract = {The parameterization of moist convection contributes to uncertainty in climate modeling and numerical weather prediction. Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and nonnegativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large-scale environment.},

While they were successfully applied to many problems, training a GAN is a notoriously challenging task and requires a significant number of hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture engineering, and a non-trivial amount of "tricks". The success in many practical applications coupled with the lack of a measure to quantify the failure modes of GANs resulted in a plethora of proposed losses, regularization and normalization schemes, as well as neural architectures. In this work we take a sober view of the current state of GANs from a practical perspective.

	abstract = {Semantic image inpainting is a challenging task where large missing regions have to be filled based on the available visual data. Existing methods which extract information from only a single image generally produce unsatisfactory results due to the lack of high level context. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semantic image inpainting, which generates the missing content by conditioning on the available data. Given a trained generative model, we search for the closest encoding of the corrupted image in the latent image manifold using our context and prior losses. This encoding is then passed through the generative model to infer the missing content. In our method, inference is possible irrespective of how the missing content is structured, while the state-of-the-art learning based method requires specific information about the holes in the training phase. Experiments on three datasets show that our method successfully predicts information in large missing regions and achieves pixel-level photorealism, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations in short-term, medium-range, and seasonal forecasts: operational weather centers now routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to represent model inadequacy better and to improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. Developed initially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations not only provides better estimates of uncertainty, but it is also extremely promising for reducing long-standing climate biases and is relevant for determining the climate response to external forcing. This article highlights recent developments from different research groups that show that the stochastic representation of unresolved processes in the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and cryosphere of comprehensive weather and climate models 1) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate and 2) reduces systematic model bias. We make a case that the use of mathematically stringent methods for the derivation of stochastic dynamic equations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability to accurately simulate weather and climate at all scales. Recent work in mathematics, statistical mechanics, and turbulence is reviewed; its relevance for the climate problem is demonstrated; and future research directions are outlined.},

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

To solve video generation from scratch, we build a two-stage framework where we ﬁrst train a deep generative model that generates human pose sequences from random noise, and then train a skeleton-toimage network to synthesize human action videos given the human pose sequences generated. To solve video prediction and completion, we exploit our trained model and conduct optimization over the latent space to generate videos that best suit the given input frame constraints. With our novel method, we sidestep the original ill-posed problems and produce for the ﬁrst time high-quality video generation/prediction/completion results of much longer duration. We present quantitative and qualitative evaluations to show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all three tasks.},

Our model uses an encoder LSTM to map an input sequence into a fixed length representation. This representation is decoded using single or multiple decoder LSTMs to perform different tasks, such as reconstructing the input sequence, or predicting the future sequence. We experiment with two kinds of input sequences - patches of image pixels and high-level representations ("percepts") of video frames extracted using a pretrained convolutional net. We explore different design choices such as whether the decoder LSTMs should condition on the generated output. We analyze the outputs of the model qualitatively to see how well the model can extrapolate the learned video representation into the future and into the past. We try to visualize and interpret the learned features. We stress test the model by running it on longer time scales and on out-of-domain data. We further evaluate the representations by finetuning them for a supervised learning problem - human action recognition on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. We show that the representations help improve classification accuracy, especially when there are only a few training examples. Even models pretrained on unrelated datasets (300 hours of YouTube videos) can help action recognition performance.},

	abstract = {Modeling studies have shown that cloud feedbacks are sensitive to the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, while cloud feedbacks themselves strongly influence the magnitude of SST anomalies. Observational counterparts to such patterned interactions are still needed. Here we show that distinct large-scale patterns of SST and low-cloud cover (LCC) emerge naturally from objective analyses of observations and demonstrate their close coupling in a positive local SST-LCC feedback loop that may be important for both internal variability and climate change. The two patterns that explain the maximum amount of covariance between SST and LCC correspond to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, leading modes of multidecadal internal variability. Spatial patterns and time series of SST and LCC anomalies associated with both modes point to a strong positive local SST-LCC feedback. In many current climate models, our analyses suggest that SST-LCC feedback strength is too weak compared to observations. Modeled local SST-LCC feedback strength affects simulated internal variability so that stronger feedback produces more intense and more realistic patterns of internal variability. To the extent that the physics of the local positive SST-LCC feedback inferred from observed climate variability applies to future greenhouse warming, we anticipate significant amount of delayed warming because of SST-LCC feedback when anthropogenic SST warming eventually overwhelm the effects of internal variability that may mute anthropogenic warming over parts of the ocean. We postulate that many climate models may be underestimating both future warming and the magnitude of modeled internal variability because of their weak SST-LCC feedback.},

AI-CD uses a conditional generative adversarial net (cGAN) framework to model distribution of 2-D cloud reflectance in nature as observed by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Specifically, the AI-CD models the conditional distribution of cloud reflectance fields given a set of large-scale environmental conditions such as instantaneous sea surface temperature, estimated inversion strength, surface wind speed, relative humidity and large-scale subsidence rate together with random noise. We show that AI-CD can not only generate realistic cloudy scenes but also capture known, physical dependence of cloud properties on large-scale variables. AI-CD is stochastic in nature because generated cloud fields are influenced by random noise. Therefore, given a fixed set of large-scale variables, an ensemble of cloud reflectance fields can be generated using AI-CD. We suggest that AI-CD approach can be used as a data driven framework for stochastic cloud parameterization because it can realistically model sub-grid cloud distributions and their sensitivity to meteorological variables.},

Furthermore, we review the adoption of these methods for anomaly across various application domains and assess their effectiveness. We have grouped state-of-the-art research techniques into different categories based on the underlying assumptions and approach adopted. Within each category we outline the basic anomaly detection technique, along with its variants and present key assumptions, to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior.

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is a classical problem where the aim is to detect anomalous data that do not belong to the normal data distribution. Current state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection on complex high-dimensional data are based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). However, the traditional GAN loss is not directly aligned with the anomaly detection objective: it encourages the distribution of the generated samples to overlap with the real data and so the resulting discriminator has been found to be ineffective as an anomaly detector. In this paper, we propose simple modifications to the GAN loss such that the generated samples lie at the boundary of the real data distribution. With our modified GAN loss, our anomaly detection method, called Fence GAN (FGAN), directly uses the discriminator score as an anomaly threshold. Our experimental results using the MNIST, CIFAR10 and KDD99 datasets show that Fence GAN yields the best anomaly classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08838},
	abstract = {Many recently trained neural networks employ large numbers of parameters to achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters required as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are such notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt to answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase the dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear, and define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The approach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies little across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter result has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement, and other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from MNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes wandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a solution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing networks, in some cases by more than 100 times.},

By resolving the transient dynamics of convective storms in the tropics, global storm-resolving models remove the need to parameterize tropical deep convection, providing a fundamentally more sound representation of the climate system and a more natural link to commensurately high-resolution data from satellite-borne sensors. The models and some basic characteristics of their output are described in more detail, as is the availability and planned use of this output for future scientific study. Tropically and zonally averaged energy budgets, precipitable water distributions, and precipitation from the model ensemble are evaluated, as is their representation of tropical cyclones and the predictability of column water vapor, the latter being important for tropical weather.},

Open cellular patterns which preferably occur in cyclonic synoptic-scale flow portray the oceans as a major energy source for driving the atmosphere's circulation. Closed cellular patterns, on the other hand, usually occurring under conditions of anticyclonic synoptic-scale flow, portray the oceans as a weak sink for the atmosphere's energy.},

	abstract = {Results are presented from a detailed case study of daytime stratocumulus over the North Sea using an instrumented aircraft. The measurements include turbulence fluctuation data, radiation fluxes and droplet spectra and were made both in and out of cloud. The mean structure is discussed and a diagnostic, one-dimensional, mixed layer model is formulated to predict the variation of turbulent fluxes with height and to assess the sensitivity of these solutions to various physical processes. These predictions are compared with observations enabling the effectiveness of some widely used model assumptions to be tested. Water transport by gravitational settling is found to be important throughout the depth of the cloud. Mixing within the cloud is driven by convection generated primarily by radiative effects: strong cooling from cloud top with warming beneath although the net heating of the cloud layer is close to zero. Turbulent kinetic energy is exported downwards via negatively buoyant elements from the zone of intense cooling near cloud top into the body of the cloud. This appears to be achieved by the combined action of the turbulent transport and velocity-pressure correlation terms in the turbulent kinetic energy balance equation which are therefore important in maintaining mixing in the lower part of the cloud. The cloud and sub-cloud layers are found to be decoupled, i.e. they appear as two separated mixed layers. Reasons for this are examined and some further consequences for cloud evolution are investigated. In the particular case studied, potential instability could be generated in the lower layer leading to low-level cumulus formation. These rise into the stratocumulus layer thereby reconnecting the two previously separated regions. The implications for stratiform cloud modelling are discussed and some recommendations for future work made.},

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of classifying low clouds mesoscale morphology with no human supervision by training an InfoGAN. We take a set of latent variables as mesoscale cloud morphology categories and successfully train a generator to map each category variable to realistic images that belong to a corresponding mesoscale morphology. The trained generator generates visually realistic cloud scenes. Furthermore, the model learns ten physically meaningful categories each corresponding to a particular morphology. We also show that by perturbing other latent variables while keeping the cloud category variable the same, the model can generate images that have the same morphology but with substantial variations. The trained discriminator can be used to classify real cloud scenes with limited training samples in the future.},

MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA’s terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

An examination of time-varying meteorological conditions associated with satellite-observed open and closed MCC clouds is conducted to illustrate the influence of large-scale meteorological conditions. Marine cold air outbreaks (MCAO) influence the development of open MCC clouds and the transition from closed to open MCC clouds. MCC neural network classifications on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 2008 are collocated with Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data and ERA-Interim reanalysis to determine the radiative effects of MCC clouds and their thermodynamic environments. Closed MCC clouds are found to have much higher albedo on average than open MCC clouds for the same cloud fraction. Three meteorological control metrics are tested: sea-air temperature difference (ΔT), estimated inversion strength (EIS), and a MCAO index (M). These predictive metrics illustrate the importance of atmospheric surface forcing and static stability for open and closed MCC cloud formation. Predictive sigmoidal relations are found between M and MCC cloud frequency globally and regionally: negative for closed MCC cloud and positive for open MCC cloud. The open MCC cloud seasonal cycle is well correlated with M, while the seasonality of closed MCC clouds is well correlated with M in the midlatitudes and EIS in the tropics and subtropics. M is found to best distinguish open and closed MCC clouds on average over shorter time scales. The possibility of a MCC cloud feedback is discussed.},

We show that our hybrid model, despite the invertibility constraints, achieves similar accuracy to purely predictive models. Moreover the generative component remains a good model of the input features despite the hybrid optimization objective. This offers additional capabilities such as detection of out-of-distribution inputs and enabling semi-supervised learning. The availability of the exact joint density p(targets, features) also allows us to compute many quantities readily, making our hybrid model a useful building block for downstream applications of probabilistic deep learning.},

	abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The radiative forcing of dust and its impact on precipitation over the West Africa monsoon (WAM) region is simulated using a coupled meteorology and aerosol/chemistry model (WRF-Chem). During the monsoon season, dust is a dominant contributor to aerosol optical depth (AOD) over West Africa. In the control simulation, on 24-h domain average, dust has a cooling effect (−6.11 W m−2) at the surface, a warming effect (6.94 W m−2) in the atmosphere, and a relatively small TOA forcing (0.83 W m−2). Dust modifies the surface energy budget and atmospheric diabatic heating. As a result, atmospheric stability is increased in the daytime and reduced in the nighttime, leading to a reduction of late afternoon precipitation by up to 0.14 mm/h (25\%) and an increase of nocturnal and early morning precipitation by up to 0.04 mm/h (45\%) over the WAM region. Dust-induced reduction of diurnal precipitation variation improves the simulated diurnal cycle of precipitation when compared to measurements. However, daily precipitation is only changed by a relatively small amount (−0.17 mm/day or −4\%). The dust-induced change of WAM precipitation is not sensitive to interannual monsoon variability. On the other hand, sensitivity simulations with weaker to stronger absorbing dust (in order to represent the uncertainty in dust solar absorptivity) show that, at the lower atmosphere, dust longwave warming effect in the nighttime surpasses its shortwave cooling effect in the daytime; this leads to a less stable atmosphere associated with more convective precipitation in the nighttime. As a result, the dust-induced change of daily WAM precipitation varies from a significant reduction of −0.52 mm/day (−12\%, weaker absorbing dust) to a small increase of 0.03 mm/day (1\%, stronger absorbing dust). This variation originates from the competition between dust impact on daytime and nighttime precipitation, which depends on dust shortwave absorption. Dust reduces the diurnal variation of precipitation regardless of its absorptivity, but more reduction is associated with stronger absorbing dust.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric mineral dust has recently become an important research field in Earth system science because of its impacts on radiation, clouds, atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, air quality, and biogeochemical cycles. Studying and modeling dust emission and transport over the world's largest source region, the Sahara, is particularly challenging because of the complex meteorology and a very sparse observational network. Recent advances in satellite retrievals together with ground- and aircraft-based field campaigns have fostered our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of the dust aerosol and its atmospheric drivers. We now have a more complete picture of the key processes in the atmosphere associated with dust emission. These cover a range of scales from (1) synoptic scale cyclones in the northern sector of the Sahara, harmattan surges and African easterly waves, through (2) low-level jets and cold pools of mesoscale convective systems (particularly over the Sahel), to (3) microscale dust devils and dusty plumes, each with its own pronounced diurnal and seasonal characteristics. This paper summarizes recent progress on monitoring and analyzing the dust distribution over the Sahara and discusses implications for numerical modeling. Among the key challenges for the future are a better quantification of the relative importance of single processes and a more realistic representation of the effects of the smaller-scale meteorological features in dust models. In particular, moist convection has been recognized as a major limitation to our understanding because of the inability of satellites to observe dust under clouds and the difficulties of numerical models to capture convective organization.},

	abstract = {Dust uplift is a nonlinear thresholded function of wind speed and therefore particularly sensitive to the long tails of observed wind speed probability density functions. This suggests that a few rare high-wind events can contribute substantially to annual dust emission. Here we quantify the relative roles of different wind speeds to dust-generating winds using surface synoptic observations of dust emission and wind from northern Africa. The results show that winds between 2 and 5 m s−1 above the threshold cause the most emission. Of the dust-generating winds, 25\% is produced by very rare events occurring only at 0.1 to 1.4\% of the time, depending on the region. Dust-producing winds are underestimated in ERA-I, since it misses the long tail found in observations. ERA-I overpredicts (underpredicts) the frequency of emission strength winds in the southern (northern) regions. These problems cannot be solved by simple tunings. Finally, we show that rare events make the largest contribution to interannual variability in dust-generating winds and that ERA severely underestimates this interannual variability.},

Global climate models (GCMs), which attempt to represent all relevant physical processes, provide the most direct means of estimating climate sensitivity via CO quadrupling experiments. Here we show that the closely related effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), with values spanning 1.8–5.6 K across 27 GCMs and exceeding 4.5 K in 10 of them. This (statistically insignificant) increase is primarily due to stronger positive cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo. Both of these are tied to the physical representation of clouds which in CMIP6 models lead to weaker responses of extratropical low cloud cover and water content to unforced variations in surface temperature. Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications.},

	abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

Collection 6 (C6) reprocessing of the product was completed in May 2014 and March 2015 for MODIS Aqua and Terra, respectively. Here we provide an overview of major C6 optical property algorithm changes relative to the previous Collection 5 (C5) product. Notable C6 optical and microphysical algorithm changes include: 1) new ice cloud optical property models and a more extensive cloud radiative transfer code lookup table (LUT) approach; 2) improvement in the skill of the shortwave-derived cloud thermodynamic phase; 3) separate cloud effective radius retrieval data sets for each spectral combination used in previous collections; 4) separate retrievals for partly cloudy pixels and those associated with cloud edges; 5) failure metrics that provide diagnostic information for pixels having observations that fall outside the LUT solution space; and 6) enhanced pixel-level retrieval uncertainty calculations. The C6 algorithm changes can collectively result in significant changes relative to C5, though the magnitude depends on the data set and the pixel's retrieval location in the cloud parameter space. Example L2 granule and level-3 gridded data set differences between the two collections are shown.

It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

We evaluate these activation function on standard image classification task. Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as effective as using their randomized counterpart. By using RReLU, we achieved 75.68{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 test set without multiple test or ensemble.},

	abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

The measurement uncertainties account for correlations between errors in observations made by the same ship or buoy due, for example, to miscalibration of the thermometer. Correlations between the errors increase the estimated uncertainties on grid box averages. In grid boxes where there are many observations from only a few ships or drifting buoys, this increase can be large. The correlations also increase uncertainties of regional, hemispheric, and global averages above and beyond the increase arising solely from the inflation of the grid box uncertainties. This is due to correlations in the errors between grid boxes visited by the same ship or drifting buoy. At times when reliable estimates can be made, the uncertainties in global average, Southern Hemisphere, and tropical sea surface temperature anomalies are between 2 and 3 times as large as when calculated assuming the errors are uncorrelated. Uncertainties of Northern Hemisphere averages are approximately double. A new estimate is also made of sampling uncertainties. They are largest in regions of high sea surface temperature variability such as the western boundary currents and along the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean. The sampling uncertainties are generally smaller in the tropics and in the ocean gyres.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are known to affect the amount of ice in mixed-phase clouds, thereby influencing many of their properties. The atmospheric INP concentration changes by orders of magnitude from terrestrial to marine environments, which typically contain much lower concentrations. Many modelling studies use parameterizations for heterogeneous ice nucleation and cloud ice processes that do not account for this difference because they were developed based on INP measurements made predominantly in terrestrial environments without considering the aerosol composition. Errors in the assumed INP concentration will influence the simulated amount of ice in mixed-phase clouds, leading to errors in top-of-atmosphere radiative flux and ultimately the climate sensitivity of the model. Here we develop a global model of INP concentrations relevant for mixed-phase clouds based on laboratory and field measurements of ice nucleation by K-feldspar (an ice-active component of desert dust) and marine organic aerosols (from sea spray). The simulated global distribution of INP concentrations based on these two species agrees much better with currently available ambient measurements than when INP concentrations are assumed to depend only on temperature or particle size. Underestimation of INP concentrations in some terrestrial locations may be due to the neglect of INPs from other terrestrial sources. Our model indicates that, on a monthly average basis, desert dusts dominate the contribution to the INP population over much of the world, but marine organics become increasingly important over remote oceans and they dominate over the Southern Ocean. However, day-to-day variability is important. Because desert dust aerosol tends to be sporadic, marine organic aerosols dominate the INP population on many days per month over much of the mid- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere. This study advances our understanding of which aerosol species need to be included in order to adequately describe the global and regional distribution of INPs in models, which will guide ice nucleation researchers on where to focus future laboratory and field work.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we combine cloud-resolving model simulations with estimates of the concentration of ice-nucleating particles in this region to show that our simulated Southern Ocean clouds reflect far more radiation than predicted by global models, in agreement with satellite observations. Specifically, we show that the clouds that are most sensitive to the concentration of ice-nucleating particles are low-level mixed-phase clouds in the cold sectors of extratropical cyclones, which have previously been identified as a main contributor to the Southern Ocean radiation bias. The very low ice-nucleating particle concentrations that prevail over the Southern Ocean strongly suppress cloud droplet freezing, reduce precipitation, and enhance cloud reflectivity. The results help explain why a strong radiation bias occurs mainly in this remote region away from major sources of ice-nucleating particles. The results present a substantial challenge to climate models to be able to simulate realistic ice-nucleating particle concentrations and their effects under specific meteorological conditions.},

Here we use measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) to quantify global Cphyto and POC from retrievals of subsurface particulate backscatter coefficients (bbp). CALIOP bbp data compare favorably with airborne, ship-based, and passive ocean data and yield global average mixed-layer standing stocks of 0.44 Pg C for Cphyto and 1.9 Pg for POC. CALIOP-based Cphyto and POC data exhibit global distributions and seasonal variations consistent with ocean plankton ecology.

Excluding time periods with large volcanic influence, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface concentration over polluted land regions generally vary with anthropogenic emissions, but the magnitude of this association can be dampened by the presence of natural aerosols, especially dust. Over the 30-year period in this study, the largest reduction in aerosol levels occurs over Europe, where AOD has decreased by 40–60\% on average and surface sulfate concentrations have declined by a factor of up to 3–4. In contrast, East Asia and South Asia show AOD increases, but the relatively high level of dust aerosols in Asia reduces the correlation between AOD and pollutant emission trends. Over major dust source regions, model analysis indicates that the change of dust emissions over the Sahara and Sahel has been predominantly driven by the change of near-surface wind speed, but over Central Asia it has been largely influenced by the change of the surface wetness. The decreasing dust trend in the North African dust outflow region of the tropical North Atlantic and the receptor sites of Barbados and Miami is closely associated with an increase of the sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic. This temperature increase may drive the decrease of the wind velocity over North Africa, which reduces the dust emission, and the increase of precipitation over the tropical North Atlantic, which enhances dust removal during transport. Despite significant trends over some major continental source regions, the model-calculated global annual average AOD shows little change over land and ocean in the past three decades, because opposite trends in different land regions cancel each other out in the global average, and changes over large open oceans are negligible. This highlights the necessity for regional-scale assessment of aerosols and their climate impacts, as global-scale average values can obscure important regional changes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

During this interval of global warming, the decay of ice sheets caused global mean sea level to rise by approximately 80 m; terrestrial and marine ecosystems experienced large disturbances and range shifts; perturbations to the carbon cycle resulted in a net release of the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere; and changes in atmosphere and ocean circulation affected the global distribution and fluxes of water and heat. Here we summarize a major effort by the paleoclimate research community to characterize these changes through the development of well-dated, high-resolution records of the deep and intermediate ocean as well as surface climate. Our synthesis indicates that the superposition of two modes explains much of the variability in regional and global climate during the last deglaciation, with a strong association between the first mode and variations in greenhouse gases, and between the second mode and variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.},

By connecting individual shiptracks to transponder data, it is shown that almost half of shiptracks are likely undetected, masking a significant contribution to the climate impact of shipping.

Moreover, the meteorological parameters controlling the LWP responses are strikingly similar between the volcano and ship tracks. In stark contrast to observations, there are substantial unidirectional increases in LWP in the Hadley Centre climate model, because the model accounts only for the decreased precipitation efficiency and not for the enhanced entrainment drying. If the LWP increases in the model were compensated by the decreases as the observations suggest, its indirect aerosol radiative forcing in stratocumulus regions would decrease by 45\%.},

An increase in the amount of water inside liquid-phase clouds induced by aerosols, through the suppression of rain formation, has been postulated to lead to substantial cooling, which would imply that the Earth’s surface temperature is highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Here we provide direct observational evidence that, instead of a strong increase, aerosols cause a relatively weak average decrease in the amount of water in liquid-phase clouds compared with unpolluted clouds. Measurements of polluted clouds downwind of various anthropogenic sources—such as oil refineries, smelters, coal-fired power plants, cities, wildfires and ships—reveal that aerosol-induced cloud-water increases, caused by suppressed rain formation, and decreases, caused by enhanced evaporation of cloud water, partially cancel each other out. We estimate that the observed decrease in cloud water offsets 29\% of the global climate-cooling effect caused by aerosol-induced increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. These findings invalidate the hypothesis that increases in cloud water cause a substantial climate cooling effect and translate into reduced uncertainty in projections of future climate.},

The magnitude of the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on the formation of clouds is an important unknown about how humans are affecting climate. Studies of stratocumulus cloud tracks that are formed by ship exhaust have been used to estimate the radiative impact of this process, but Glassmeier et al. now show that this approach overestimates the cooling effect of aerosol addition by up to 200\%. These findings underscore the need to quantify stratocumulus cloud responses to anthropogenic aerosols to understand the climate system.
Science, this issue p. 485
The effect of anthropogenic aerosol on the reflectivity of stratocumulus cloud decks through changes in cloud amount is a major uncertainty in climate projections. In frequently occurring nonprecipitating stratocumulus, cloud amount can decrease through aerosol-enhanced cloud-top mixing. The climatological relevance of this effect is debated because ship exhaust only marginally reduces stratocumulus amount. By comparing detailed numerical simulations with satellite analyses, we show that ship-track studies cannot be generalized to estimate the climatological forcing of anthropogenic aerosol. The ship track–derived sensitivity of the radiative effect of nonprecipitating stratocumulus to aerosol overestimates their cooling effect by up to 200\%. The offsetting warming effect of decreasing stratocumulus amount needs to be taken into account if we are to constrain the cloud-mediated radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosol.
Anthropogenic aerosols have a weaker cooling effect than ship-track studies suggest.

The enormity of the problem is reflected in the need to understand aspects such as aerosol composition, optical properties, cloud condensation, and ice nucleation potential, along with the global distribution of these properties, controlled by emissions, transport, transformation, and sinks. Equally daunting is that clouds themselves are complex, turbulent, microphysical entities and, by their very nature, ephemeral and hard to predict. Atmospheric general circulation models represent aerosol−cloud interactions at ever-increasing levels of detail, but these models lack the resolution to represent clouds and aerosol−cloud interactions adequately. There is a dearth of observational constraints on aerosol−cloud interactions. We develop a conceptual approach to systematically constrain the aerosol−cloud radiative effect in shallow clouds through a combination of routine process modeling and satellite and surface-based shortwave radiation measurements. We heed the call to merge Darwinian and Newtonian strategies by balancing microphysical detail with scaling and emergent properties of the aerosol−cloud radiation system.},

ML has recently exploded in popularity in many fields, including meteorology. Although ML has been successful in meteorology, it has not been as widely accepted, primarily due to the perception that ML models are “black boxes,” meaning the ML methods are thought to take inputs and provide outputs but not to yield physically interpretable information to the user. This paper introduces and demonstrates multiple MIV techniques for both traditional ML and deep learning, to enable meteorologists to understand what ML models have learned. We discuss permutation-based predictor importance, forward and backward selection, saliency maps, class-activation maps, backward optimization, and novelty detection. We apply these methods at multiple spatiotemporal scales to tornado, hail, winter precipitation type, and convective-storm mode. By analyzing such a wide variety of applications, we intend for this work to demystify the black box of ML, offer insight in applying MIV techniques, and serve as a MIV toolbox for meteorologists and other physical scientists.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

We show that the timing of the breakup is strongly modulated by the diurnal cycle and large-scale meteorology but varies systematically with the initial aerosol concentration: the more polluted the clouds, the later the breakup. This indicates that the cloud radiative effect via cloud cover adjustments is not saturated, in contrast to the effect of aerosol on cloud albedo at fixed cloudiness, which weakens with increasing aerosol levels. The results also show that the cloud radiative impact of anthropogenic aerosol is strongest far from its origin over land.},

	abstract = {The influence of aerosol particles on cloud reflectivity remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Commercial shipping constitutes a large and concentrated aerosol perturbation in a meteorological regime where clouds have a disproportionally large effect on climate. Yet, to date, studies have been unable to detect climatologically relevant cloud radiative effects from shipping, despite models indicating that the cloud response should produce a sizable negative radiative forcing (perturbation to Earth's energy balance). We attribute a significant increase in cloud reflectivity to enhanced cloud droplet number concentrations within a major shipping corridor in the southeast Atlantic. Prevailing winds constrain emissions around the corridor, which cuts through a climatically important region of expansive low cloud cover. We use universal kriging, a classic geostatistical method, to estimate what cloud properties would have been in the absence of shipping. In the morning, cloud brightening is consistent with changes in microphysics alone, whereas in the afternoon, increases in cloud brightness from microphysical changes are offset by decreases in the total amount of cloud water. We calculate an effective radiative forcing within the southeast Atlantic shipping corridor of approximately −2 W/m2. Several years of data are required to identify a clear signal. Extrapolating our results globally, we calculate an effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions in low clouds of −1.0 W/m2 (95\% confidence interval: −1.6 to −0.4 W/m2). The unique setup in the southeast Atlantic could be an ideal test for the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models.},

A combination of satellite and reanalysis data is used here to analyze regions in which major shipping lanes cut through otherwise pristine marine environments in subtropical and tropical oceans. We expect the region downwind of a shipping lane is affected by the aerosol produced by shipping emissions but not the one upwind. Thus, differences in microphysical and macrophysical cloud properties are analyzed statistically. We investigate microphysical and macrophysical cloud properties as well as the aerosol optical depth and its fine-mode fraction for the years 2005–2007 as provided for by retrievals of the two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments. Water-cloud properties include cloud optical depth, cloud droplet effective radius, cloud top temperature, and cloud top pressure. Large-scale meteorological parameters are taken from ERA-Interim reanalysis data and microwave remote sensing (sea surface temperature). We analyze the regions of interest in a Eulerian and Lagrangian sense, i.e., sampling along shipping lanes and sampling along wind trajectories, respectively. No statistically significant impacts of shipping emissions on large-scale cloud fields could be found in any of the selected regions close to major shipping lanes.

There are various real-world scenarios in which humans need to make actionable decisions based on the output DNNs. Such decision support systems can be found in critical domains, such as legislation, law enforcement, etc. It is important that the humans making high-level decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by combinations of data features that are appropriate in the context of the deployment of the decision support system and that the decisions made are legally or ethically defensible. Due to the incredible pace at which DNN technology is being developed, the development of new methods and studies on explaining the decision-making process of DNNs has blossomed into an active research field. A practitioner beginning to study explainable deep learning may be intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal directions the field is taking. This complexity is further exacerbated by the general confusion that exists in defining what it means to be able to explain the actions of a deep learning system and to evaluate a system's "ability to explain". To alleviate this problem, this article offers a "field guide" to deep learning explainability for those uninitiated in the field. The field guide: i) Discusses the traits of a deep learning system that researchers enhance in explainability research, ii) places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research areas, and iii) introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning. The guide is designed as an easy-to-digest starting point for those just embarking in the field.},

In the ocean, ship-based activities are thought to have been impacted due to severe restrictions on human movements and changes in consumption. Here, we quantify and map global change in marine traffic during the first half of 2020. There were decreases in 70.2\% of Exclusive Economic Zones but changes varied spatially and temporally in alignment with confinement measures. Global declines peaked in April, with a reduction in traffic occupancy of 1.4\% and decreases found across 54.8\% of the sampling units. Passenger vessels presented more marked and longer lasting decreases. A regional assessment in the Western Mediterranean Sea gave further insights regarding the pace of recovery and long-term changes. Our approach provides guidance for large-scale monitoring of the progress and potential effects of COVID-19 on vessel traffic that may subsequently influence the blue economy and ocean health.},

	abstract = {One year of ENVISAT-AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer) satellite data is analyzed to derive a global distribution of ship tracks and their radiative forcing (RF). Ship tracks are changes in cloud reflectance, visible in satellite data, and result from the emission of aerosols and their precursors by ships into the clean marine boundary layer. An algorithm is presented that extracts scenes dominated by low clouds over the oceans that are susceptible to be affected by ship emissions. These selected cloud scenes are used to examine ship tracks on a global scale via visual analysis. The results show a high temporal variability of ship track occurrence with peak values in July. They also show a high spatial variability with peak values in the North Pacific Ocean and on the west coast of southern Africa, correlated with high ship traffic and frequent low cloud occurrence in regions of cold upwelling ocean currents. The analysis of backscattered radiation at top of the atmosphere (TOA) compared to the surrounding area reveals enhanced backscattering with values between 0 and 100 Wm−2. For particular regions on the west coast of North America, the annual mean RF due to ship tracks estimated by the changes in backscattered radiation at TOA can be up to −50 mWm−2. The global annual mean RF due to ship tracks is small (−0.4 to −0.6 mWm−2) and negligible compared to previous global model estimates on the total indirect aerosol effect and RF contributions of other ship emissions.},

	abstract = {Strict limits on the maximum sulphur content in fuel used by ships have recently been imposed in some Emission Control Areas (ECAs). In order to comply with these regulations many ship operators will switch to more expensive low-sulphur fuel when sailing inside ECAs. Since they are concerned about minimizing their costs, it is likely that speed and routing decisions will change because of this. In this paper, we develop an optimization model to be applied by ship operators for determining sailing paths and speeds that minimize operating costs for a ship along a given sequence of ports. We perform a computational study on a number of realistic shipping routes in order to evaluate possible impacts on sailing paths and speeds, and hence fuel consumption and costs, from the ECA regulations. Moreover, the aim is to examine the implications for the society with regards to environmental effects. Comparisons of cases show that a likely effect of the regulations is that ship operators will often choose to sail longer distances to avoid sailing time within ECAs. Another effect is that they will sail at lower speeds within and higher speeds outside the ECAs in order to use less of the more expensive fuel. On some shipping routes, this might give a considerable increase in the total amount of fuel consumed and the CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {The cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) is of central interest to improve the understanding of cloud physics and for quantifying the effective radiative forcing by aerosol-cloud interactions. Current standard satellite retrievals do not operationally provide Nd, but it can be inferred from retrievals of cloud optical depth (τc) cloud droplet effective radius (re) and cloud top temperature. This review summarizes issues with this approach and quantifies uncertainties. A total relative uncertainty of 78\% is inferred for pixel-level retrievals for relatively homogeneous, optically thick and unobscured stratiform clouds with favorable viewing geometry. The uncertainty is even greater if these conditions are not met. For averages over 1° ×1° regions the uncertainty is reduced to 54\% assuming random errors for instrument uncertainties. In contrast, the few evaluation studies against reference in situ observations suggest much better accuracy with little variability in the bias. More such studies are required for a better error characterization. Nd uncertainty is dominated by errors in re, and therefore, improvements in re retrievals would greatly improve the quality of the Nd retrievals. Recommendations are made for how this might be achieved. Some existing Nd data sets are compared and discussed, and best practices for the use of Nd data from current passive instruments (e.g., filtering criteria) are recommended. Emerging alternative Nd estimates are also considered. First, new ideas to use additional information from existing and upcoming spaceborne instruments are discussed, and second, approaches using high-quality ground-based observations are examined.},

The model estimates the collective impact of many point-source particle sprayers, each of which generates a plume of injected particles that affects clouds over a limited area. A widely-used aerosol activation scheme is used to derive cloud droplet concentration as a function of the sub-cloud aerosol size distribution and updraft speed, and a modified version of Twomey's formulation is used to estimate radiative forcing. Plume overlap is accounted for using a Poisson distribution assuming idealized elongated cuboid plumes that have a length driven by aerosol lifetime and wind speed, a width consistent with satellite observations of ship track broadening, and a depth equal to an assumed boundary layer depth. The model is found to perform favorably against estimates of brightening from large eddy simulation studies that explicitly model cloud responses to aerosol injections over a range of conditions. Although the heuristic model does not account for cloud condensate or coverage adjustments to aerosol, in most realistic ambient remote marine conditions these tend to augment the Twomey effect in the large eddy simulations, with the resulting being a modest underprediction of brightening in the heuristic model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The heuristic model is used to evaluate the potential for global radiative forcing from marine cloud brightening as a function of the quantity, size, and lifetime of salt particles injected per sprayer and the number of sprayers deployed. Radiative forcing is sensitive to both the background aerosol size distribution in the marine boundary layer into which particles are injected, and the assumed updraft speed. Given representative values from the literature, radiative forcing sufficient to offset a doubling of carbon dioxide \&Delta;{\textless}em{\textgreater}F{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2xCO2}}$ is possible but would require spraying over 50\% or more of the ocean area. This is likely to require at least 10$^{\textrm{4}}$ sprayers to avoid major losses of particles due to near-sprayer coagulation. The optimal dry diameter of injected particles, for a given salt mass injection rate, is 30\&ndash;60 nm. A major consequence is that the total salt emission rate (50\&ndash;70\&thinsp;Tg/yr) required to offset {\textless}em{\textgreater}F{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2xCO2}}$ is a factor of five lower than the emissions rates required to generate significant forcing in previous studies with climate models, which have mostly assumed dry diameters for injected particles in excess of 200\&thinsp;nm. With the lower required emissions, the salt mass loading in the marine boundary layer for {\textless}em{\textgreater}F{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2xCO2}}$ is dominated by natural salt aerosol, with injected particles only contributing {\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;10\%. When using particle sizes optimized for cloud brightening, the aerosol direct radiative forcing is shown to make a minimal contribution to the overall radiative forcing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Given that clouds over the ocean are of great climatic significance, and that sulphate aerosols seem to be an important control on marine cloud formation1, anthropogenic inputs of sulphate to the marine atmosphere could exert an important influence on climate. Recently, sulphur emissions from fossil fuel burning by international shipping have been geographically characterized2, indicating that ship sulphur emissions nearly equal the natural sulphur flux from ocean to atmosphere in many areas3. Here we use a global chemical transport model to show that these ship emissions can be a dominant contributor to atmospheric sulphur dioxide concentrations over much of the world's oceans and in several coastal regions. The ship emissions also contribute significantly to atmospheric non-seasalt sulphate concentrations over Northern Hemisphere ocean regions and parts of the Southern Pacific Ocean, and indirect radiative forcing due to ship-emitted particulate matter (sulphate plus organic material) is estimated to contribute a substantial fraction to the anthropogenic perturbation of the Earth's radiation budget. The quantification of emissions from international shipping forces a re-evaluation of our present understanding of sulphur cycling and radiative forcing over the ocean.},

Specific emissions of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO$_{\textrm{2}}$) per kg of fuel emitted are higher than for road transport or aviation. Besides gaseous pollutants, ships also emit various types of particulate matter. The aerosol impacts the Earth's radiation budget directly by scattering and absorbing the solar and thermal radiation and indirectly by changing cloud properties. Here we use ECHAM5/MESSy1-MADE, a global climate model with detailed aerosol and cloud microphysics to study the climate impacts of international shipping. The simulations show that emissions from ships significantly increase the cloud droplet number concentration of low marine water clouds by up to 5\% to 30\% depending on the ship emission inventory and the geographic region. Whereas the cloud liquid water content remains nearly unchanged in these simulations, effective radii of cloud droplets decrease, leading to cloud optical thickness increase of up to 5\&ndash;10\%. The sensitivity of the results is estimated by using three different emission inventories for present-day conditions. The sensitivity analysis reveals that shipping contributes to 2.3\% to 3.6\% of the total sulfate burden and 0.4\% to 1.4\% to the total black carbon burden in the year 2000 on the global mean. In addition to changes in aerosol chemical composition, shipping increases the aerosol number concentration, e.g. up to 25\% in the size range of the accumulation mode (typically \&gt;0.1 μm) over the Atlantic. The total aerosol optical thickness over the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Northeastern Pacific increases by up to 8\&ndash;10\% depending on the emission inventory. Changes in aerosol optical thickness caused by shipping induced modification of aerosol particle number concentration and chemical composition lead to a change in the shortwave radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (ToA) under clear-sky condition of about \&minus;0.014 W/m² to \&minus;0.038 W/m² for a global annual average. The corresponding all-sky direct aerosol forcing ranges between \&minus;0.011 W/m² and \&minus;0.013 W/m². The indirect aerosol effect of ships on climate is found to be far larger than previously estimated. An indirect radiative effect of \&minus;0.19 W/m² to \&minus;0.60 W/m² (a change in the atmospheric shortwave radiative flux at ToA) is calculated here, contributing 17\% to 39\% of the total indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosols. This contribution is high because ship emissions are released in regions with frequent low marine clouds in an otherwise clean environment. In addition, the potential impact of particulate matter on the radiation budget is larger over the dark ocean surface than over polluted regions over land.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The cooling effect is, however, declining because of shipping emission controls aiming to improve air quality. We used an aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ to test whether by altering ship fuel sulfur content, the present-day aerosol-induced cooling effect from shipping could be preserved, while at the same time reducing premature mortality rates related to shipping emissions. We compared the climate and health effects of a present-day shipping emission scenario (ship fuel sulfur content of 2.7\%) with (1) a simulation with strict emission controls in the coastal waters (ship fuel sulfur content of 0.1\%) and twofold the present-day fuel sulfur content (i.e. 5.4\%) elsewhere; and (2) a scenario with global strict shipping emission controls (ship fuel sulfur content of 0.1\% in coastal waters and 0.5\% elsewhere) roughly corresponding to international agreements to be enforced by the year 2020. Scenario 1 had a slightly stronger aerosol-induced effective radiative forcing (ERF) from shipping than the present-day scenario (−0.43 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ vs. −0.39 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$) while reducing premature mortality from shipping by 69\% (globally 34 900 deaths avoided per year). Scenario 2 decreased the ERF to −0.06 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ and annual deaths by 96\% (globally 48 200 deaths avoided per year) compared to present-day. Our results show that the cooling effect of present-day emissions could be retained with simultaneous notable improvements in air quality, even though the shipping emissions from the open ocean clearly have a significant effect on continental air quality. However, increasing ship fuel sulfur content in the open ocean would violate existing international treaties, could cause detrimental side-effects, and could be classified as geoengineering.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Comparisons are made between the properties of clouds within 50 km of ship tracks and those farther than 200 km from the tracks in order to deduce the conditions that are conducive to the appearance of ship tracks in satellite images. The results indicate that the low-level clouds must be sufficiently close to the surface for ship tracks to form. Ship tracks rarely appear in low-level clouds having altitudes greater than 1 km. The distributions of visible optical depths and cloud droplet effective radii for ambient clouds in which ship tracks are embedded are the same as those for clouds without ship tracks. Cloud droplet sizes and liquid water paths for low-level clouds do not constrain the appearance of ship tracks in the imagery. The sensitivity of ship tracks to cloud altitude appears to explain why the majority of ship tracks observed from satellites off the coast of California are found south of 35°N. A small rise in the height of low-level clouds appears to explain why numerous ship tracks appeared on one day in a particular region but disappeared on the next, even though the altitudes of the low-level clouds were generally less than 1 km and the cloud cover was the same for both days. In addition, ship tracks are frequent when low-level clouds at altitudes below 1 km are extensive and completely cover large areas. The frequency of imagery pixels overcast by clouds with altitudes below 1 km is greater in the morning than in the afternoon and explains why more ship tracks are observed in the morning than in the afternoon. If the occurrence of ship tracks in satellite imagery data depends on the coupling of the clouds to the underlying boundary layer, then cloud-top altitude and the area of complete cloud cover by low-level clouds may be useful indices for this coupling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

We implement shipping emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO$_{\textrm{2}}$), black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM) for the year 2000 into the model and quantify the model's sensitivity towards uncertainties associated with the emission parameterisation as well as with the shipping emissions themselves. Sensitivity experiments are designed to investigate (i) the uncertainty in the size distribution of emitted particles, (ii) the uncertainty associated with the total amount of emissions, and (iii) the impact of reducing carbonaceous emissions from ships. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We use the results from one sensitivity experiment for a detailed discussion of shipping-induced changes in the global aerosol system as well as the resulting impact on cloud properties. From all sensitivity experiments, we find AIEs from shipping emissions to range from −0.32 ± 0.01 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ to −0.07 ± 0.01 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ (global mean value and inter-annual variability as a standard deviation). The magnitude of the AIEs depends much more on the assumed emission size distribution and subsequent aerosol microphysical interactions than on the magnitude of the emissions themselves. It is important to note that although the strongest estimate of AIEs from shipping emissions in this study is relatively large, still much larger estimates have been reported in the literature before on the basis of modelling studies. We find that omitting just carbonaceous particle emissions from ships favours new particle formation in the boundary layer. These newly formed particles contribute just about as much to the CCN budget as the carbonaceous particles would, leaving the globally averaged AIEs nearly unaltered compared to a simulation including carbonaceous particle emissions from ships.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The consolidated practice of calculating yearly emissions follows the same temporal allocation of the underlying annual statistics. However, yearly emissions might not reflect heavy pollution episodes, seasonal trends, or any time-dependant atmospheric process. This study develops high-time resolution profiles for air pollutants and greenhouse gases co- emitted by anthropogenic sources in support of atmospheric modelling, Earth observation communities and decision makers. The key novelties of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) temporal profiles are the development of (i) country/region- and sector- specific yearly profiles for all sources, (ii) time dependent yearly profiles for sources with inter-annual variability of their seasonal pattern, (iii) country- specific weekly and daily profiles to represent hourly emissions, (iv) a flexible system to compute hourly emissions including input from different users. This work creates a harmonized emission temporal distribution to be applied to any emission database as input for atmospheric models, thus promoting homogeneity in inter-comparison exercises.},

As ships pass beneath low-level clouds, particles from their plumes serve as condensation nuclei around which new cloud droplets form. The increased droplet concentrations lead to a decrease in droplet sizes. The change in sizes is manifested as an increase in the reflected sunlight observed at 3.7 {\textless}em{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/em{\textgreater}m in satellite imagery data. Images at 3.7 {\textless}em{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/em{\textgreater}m are used in a semiautomated procedure for identifying polluted portions of clouds and distinguishing them from the nearby unaffected portions. Radiances at 0.64, 3.7, and 11 {\textless}em{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/em{\textgreater}m are used to determine visible optical depths, droplet effective radii, and cloud emission temperatures for both the polluted and unpolluted portions. The analysis of several hundred 30-km segments of ship tracks reveals that changes in visible optical depths are about half the values expected, given the changes observed for the droplet radii and assuming cloud liquid water amount remains constant. Simple radiative transfer calculations indicate that the shortfall in the optical depth change is unlikely to be due solely to the absorption by the polluting particles. It is likely that polluted clouds lose liquid water. The equivalent loss is approximately 15\%–20\% of the initial cloud liquid water.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

These lockdowns had significant impacts on economic and personal activities in many countries. Several studies using satellite and surface observations have reported important changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. Global and regional chemistry-transport model studies are being performed in order to analyze the impact of these lockdowns on the distribution of atmospheric compounds. These modeling studies aim at evaluating the impact of the regional lockdowns at the global scale. In order to provide input for the global and regional model simulations, a dataset providing adjustment factors (AFs) that can easily be applied to current global and regional emission inventories has been developed. This dataset provides, for the January–August 2020 period, gridded AFs at a {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}0.1×0.1{\textless}/span{\textgreater} latitude–longitude degree resolution on a daily or monthly basis for the transportation (road, air and ship traffic), power generation, industry and residential sectors. The quantification of AFs is based on activity data collected from different databases and previously published studies. A range of AFs are provided at each grid point for model sensitivity studies. The emission AFs developed in this study are applied to the CAMS global inventory (CAMS-GLOB-ANT\_v4.2\_R1.1), and the changes in emissions of the main pollutants are discussed for different regions of the world and the first 6 months of 2020. Maximum decreases in the total emissions are found in February in eastern China, with an average reduction of 20 \%–30 \% in NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{\textit{x}}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds) and SO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} relative to the reference emissions.

For the other species, the maximum reductions are generally less than 15 \%, except in South America, where large decreases in CO and BC (black carbon) are estimated.

CMIP6 models broadly capture the observed pattern of surface- and winter-dominated Arctic warming that has outpaced both tropical and Antarctic warming in recent decades. For both CMIP5 and CMIP6, CO2 quadrupling experiments reveal that the lapse-rate and surface albedo feedbacks contribute most to stronger warming in the Arctic than the tropics or Antarctic. The relative strength of the polar surface albedo feedback in comparison to the lapse-rate feedback is sensitive to the choice of radiative kernel, and the albedo feedback contributes most to intermodel spread in polar warming at both poles. By separately calculating moist and dry atmospheric heat transport, we show that increased poleward moisture transport is another important driver of Arctic amplification and the largest contributor to projected Antarctic warming. Seasonal ocean heat storage and winter-amplified temperature feedbacks contribute most to the winter peak in warming in the Arctic and a weaker winter peak in the Antarctic. In comparison with CMIP5, stronger polar warming in CMIP6 results from a larger surface albedo feedback at both poles, combined with less-negative cloud feedbacks in the Arctic and increased poleward moisture transport in the Antarctic. However, normalizing by the global-mean surface warming yields a similar degree of Arctic amplification and only slightly increased Antarctic amplification in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5.},

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is a potentially unstable component of the Earth system and may exhibit a critical transition under ongoing global warming. Mass reductions of the GrIS have substantial impacts on global sea level and the speed of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, due to the additional freshwater caused by increased meltwater runoff into the northern Atlantic. The stability of the GrIS depends crucially on the positive melt-elevation feedback (MEF), by which melt rates increase as the overall ice sheet height decreases under rising temperatures. Melting rates across Greenland have accelerated nonlinearly in recent decades, and models predict a critical temperature threshold beyond which the current ice sheet state is not maintainable. Here, we investigate long-term melt rate and ice sheet height reconstructions from the central-western GrIS in combination with model simulations to quantify the stability of this part of the GrIS. We reveal significant early-warning signals (EWS) indicating that the central-western GrIS is close to a critical transition. By relating the statistical EWS to underlying physical processes, our results suggest that the MEF plays a dominant role in the observed, ongoing destabilization of the central-western GrIS. Our results suggest substantial further GrIS mass loss in the near future and call for urgent, observation-constrained stability assessments of other parts of the GrIS.},

The imposed perturbations act to increase the amount of heat available to melt ice, leading to a rapid Arctic sea ice retreat within 5 years after the perturbations are activated. In response, the AMOC gradually weakens over the next {\textasciitilde}100 years. The AMOC changes can be explained by the accumulation in the Arctic and subsequent downstream propagation to the North Atlantic of buoyancy anomalies controlled by temperature and salinity. Initially, during the first decade or so, the Arctic sea ice loss results in anomalous positive heat and salinity fluxes in the subpolar North Atlantic, inducing positive temperature and salinity anomalies over the regions of oceanic deep convection. At first, these anomalies largely compensate one another, leading to a minimal change in upper ocean density and deep convection in the North Atlantic. Over the following years, however, more anomalous warm water accumulates in the Arctic and spreads to the North Atlantic. At the same time, freshwater that accumulates from seasonal sea ice melting over most of the upper Arctic Ocean also spreads southward, reaching as far as south of Iceland. These warm and fresh anomalies reduce upper ocean density and suppress oceanic deep convection. The thermal and haline contributions to these buoyancy anomalies, and therefore to the AMOC slowdown during this period, are found to have similar magnitudes. We also find that the related changes in horizontal wind-driven circulation could potentially push freshwater away from the deep convection areas and hence strengthen the AMOC, but this effect is overwhelmed by mean advection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Among the largest uncertainties in quantifying the radiative impacts of clouds are those that arise from the inherent difficulty in precisely specifying the vertical distribution of cloud optical properties using passive satellite measurements. Motivated by the need to address this problem, CloudSat was launched in April 2006 carrying into orbit the first millimeter wavelength cloud radar to be flown in space. Retrieved profiles of liquid and ice cloud microphysical properties from this Cloud Profiling Radar form the basis of the CloudSat's fluxes and heating rates algorithm, 2B-FLXHR, a standard product that provides high vertical resolution profiles of radiative fluxes and atmospheric heating rates on the global scale. This paper describes the physical basis of the 2B-FLXHR algorithm and documents the first year of 2B-FLXHR data in the context of assessing the radiative impact of clouds on global and regional scales. The analysis confirms that cloud contributions to atmospheric radiative heating are small on the global scale because of a cancelation of the much larger regional heating from high clouds in the tropics and cooling from low clouds at higher latitudes. Preliminary efforts to assess the accuracy of the 2B-FLXHR product using coincident CERES data demonstrate that outgoing longwave fluxes are better represented than those in the shortwave but both exhibit good agreement with CERES on scales longer than 5 days and larger than 5°. Colocated CALIPSO observations of clouds that are undetected by CloudSat further indicate that while thin cirrus can introduce modest uncertainty in the products, low clouds that are obscured by ground clutter represent a far more important source of error in the current 2B-FLXHR product that must be addressed in subsequent versions of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

In addition, the AI-CD approach is stochastic in nature. We suggest the AI-CD approach can be used as a data-drive framework for stochastic cloud parameterization.},

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Commercial shipping is considered as an important source of air pollution and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). To assess the climatic and environmental impacts of shipping, detailed characterization of ship plumes near the point of emission and understanding of ship plume evolution further downwind are essential. This airborne measurement study presents the online characterization of particulate phase ship emissions in the region of Western Europe in 2019 prior to new international sulfur emission controls becoming enacted. More than 30 ships from both the sulfur emission control area (SECA) in the English Channel and the open sea (OS) are measured and compared. Ships within the SECA emitted much less sulfate (SO4) compared with those at OS. When shifted to a lower apparent fuel sulfur content (FSC) at similar engine loads, the peak of the fresh ship emitting the particle number size distribution shifted from around 60–80 nm in diameter to below 40 nm in diameter. The emission factors (EFs) of sulfate are predicted to decrease by around 94\% after the 2020 regulation on ship sulfur emission in the open ocean. The EFs of refractory black carbon (rBC) and organic compounds (Org) do not appear to be directly affected by the lower sulfur contents. The total number concentration for condensation nuclei (CN) {\textgreater}2.5 nm and {\textgreater}0.1 μm are predicated to be reduced by 69 and 56\%, respectively. Measured plume evolution results indicate that the S(IV) to S(VI) conversion rate was around 23.4\% per hour at the beginning of plume evolution, and the CCN and CN {\textgreater}2.5 nm ratio increased with plume age primarily due to condensation and coagulation. We estimate that the new sulfur emission regulation will lead to a reduction of more than 80\% in CCN from fresh ship emissions. The ship-emitted EFs results presented here will also inform emission inventories, policymaking, climate, and human health studies.},

The adjoint efficiently and accurately calculates the sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) to all parameterization inputs (e.g., updraft velocity, water uptake coefficient, aerosol number and hygroscopicity) with a single execution. The adjoint is then integrated within three dimensional (3-D) aerosol modeling frameworks to quantify the sensitivity of CDNC formation globally to each parameter. Sensitivities are computed for year-long executions of the NASA Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) Chemical Transport Model (CTM), using wind fields computed with the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Global Circulation Model (GCM) II', and the GEOS-Chem CTM, driven by meteorological input from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). We find that over polluted (pristine) areas, CDNC is more sensitive to updraft velocity and uptake coefficient (aerosol number and hygroscopicity). Over the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere, addition of anthropogenic or biomass burning aerosol is predicted to increase CDNC in contrast to coarse-mode sea salt which tends to decrease CDNC. Over the Southern Oceans, CDNC is most sensitive to sea salt, which is the main aerosol component of the region. Globally, CDNC is predicted to be less sensitive to changes in the hygroscopicity of the aerosols than in their concentration with the exception of dust where CDNC is very sensitive to particle hydrophilicity over arid areas. Regionally, the sensitivities differ considerably between the two frameworks and quantitatively reveal why the models differ considerably in their indirect forcing estimates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Fire emissions of gases and aerosols alter atmospheric composition and have substantial impacts on climate, ecosystem function, and human health. Warming climate and human expansion in fire-prone landscapes exacerbate fire impacts and call for more effective management tools. Here we developed a global fire forecasting system that predicts monthly emissions using past fire data and climate variables for lead times of 1 to 6 months. Using monthly fire emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) as the prediction target, we fit a statistical time series model, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with eXogenous variables (ARIMAX), in over 1,300 different fire regions. Optimized parameters were then used to forecast future emissions. The forecast system took into account information about region-specific seasonality, long-term trends, recent fire observations, and climate drivers representing both large-scale climate variability and local fire weather. We cross-validated the forecast skill of the system with different combinations of predictors and forecast lead times. The reference model, which combined endogenous and exogenous predictors with a 1 month forecast lead time, explained 52\% of the variability in the global fire emissions anomaly, considerably exceeding the performance of a reference model that assumed persistent emissions during the forecast period. The system also successfully resolved detailed spatial patterns of fire emissions anomalies in regions with significant fire activity. This study bridges the gap between the efforts of near-real-time fire forecasts and seasonal fire outlooks and represents a step toward establishing an operational global fire, smoke, and carbon cycle forecasting system.},

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements of fire radiative energy (FRE) release rates R/sub fre/ range from less than 10 to more than 1700 MW per pixel at 1-km resolution. To account for the effect of such a wide range of fire strengths/sizes on smoke emission rates, we have developed direct linear relationships between the MODIS-measured R/sub fre/ and smoke aerosol emission rates R/sub sa/ (in kilograms per second), derived by analyzing MODIS measurements of aerosol spatial distribution around the fires with National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research wind fields. We applied the technique to several regions around the world and derived a FRE-based smoke emission coefficient, C/sub e/ (in kilograms per megajoule), which can be simply multiplied by R/sub fre/ to calculate R/sub sa/. This new coefficient C/sub e/ is an excellent remote sensing parameter expressing the emission strength of different ecosystems and regions. Analysis of all 2002 MODIS data from Terra and Aqua satellites yielded C/sub e/ values of 0.02-0.06 kg/MJ for boreal regions, 0.04-0.08 kg/MJ for both tropical forests and savanna regions, and 0.08-0.1 kg/MJ for Western Russian regions. These results are probably overestimated by about 50\% because of uncertainties in some of the data, parameters, and assumptions involved in the computations. This 50\% overestimation is comparable to uncertainties in traditional emission factors. However, our satellite method shows great promise for accuracy improvement, as better knowledge is gained about the sources of the uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

Since initial publication in 2011–2012, MAIAC has changed considerably to adapt to global processing and improve cloud/snow detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction of MODIS data. The main changes include (1) transition from a 25 to 1\&thinsp;km scale for retrieval of the spectral regression coefficient (SRC) which helped to remove occasional blockiness at 25\&thinsp;km scale in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and in the surface reflectance, (2) continuous improvements of cloud detection, (3) introduction of smoke and dust tests to discriminate absorbing fine- and coarse-mode aerosols, (4) adding over-water processing, (5) general optimization of the LUT-based radiative transfer for the global processing, and others. MAIAC provides an interdisciplinary suite of atmospheric and land products, including cloud mask (CM), column water vapor (CWV), AOD at 0.47 and 0.55\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m, aerosol type (background, smoke or dust) and fine-mode fraction over water; spectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF), parameters of Ross-thick Li-sparse (RTLS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model and instantaneous albedo. For snow-covered surfaces, we provide subpixel snow fraction and snow grain size. All products come in standard HDF4 format at 1\&thinsp;km resolution, except for BRF, which is also provided at 500\&thinsp;m resolution on a sinusoidal grid adopted by the MODIS Land team. All products are provided on per-observation basis in daily files except for the BRDF/Albedo product, which is reported every 8 days. Because MAIAC uses a time series approach, BRDF/Albedo is naturally gap-filled over land where missing values are filled-in with results from the previous retrieval. While the BRDF model is reported for MODIS Land bands 1–7 and ocean band 8, BRF is reported for both land and ocean bands 1–12. This paper focuses on MAIAC cloud detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction and describes MCD19 data products and quality assurance (QA) flags.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We are interested in learning generative models for complex geometries described via manifolds, such as spheres, tori, and other implicit surfaces. Current extensions of existing (Euclidean) generative models are restricted to specific geometries and typically suffer from high computational costs. We introduce Moser Flow (MF), a new class of generative models within the family of continuous normalizing flows (CNF). MF also produces a CNF via a solution to the change-of-variable formula, however differently from other CNF methods, its model (learned) density is parameterized as the source (prior) density minus the divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a local, linear differential operator, easy to approximate and calculate on manifolds. Therefore, unlike other CNFs, MF does not require invoking or backpropagating through an ODE solver during training. Furthermore, representing the model density explicitly as the divergence of a NN rather than as a solution of an ODE facilitates learning high fidelity densities. Theoretically, we prove that MF constitutes a universal density approximator under suitable assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate for the first time the use of flow models for sampling from general curved surfaces and achieve significant improvements in density estimation, sample quality, and training complexity over existing CNFs on challenging synthetic geometries and real-world benchmarks from the earth and climate sciences.},

	abstract = {Deep convective clouds (DCCs) play a crucial role in the general circulation, energy, and hydrological cycle of our climate system. Aerosol particles can influence DCCs by altering cloud properties, precipitation regimes, and radiation balance. Previous studies reported both invigoration and suppression of DCCs by aerosols, but few were concerned with the whole life cycle of DCC. By conducting multiple monthlong cloud-resolving simulations with spectral-bin cloud microphysics that capture the observed macrophysical and microphysical properties of summer convective clouds and precipitation in the tropics and midlatitudes, this study provides a comprehensive view of how aerosols affect cloud cover, cloud top height, and radiative forcing. We found that although the widely accepted theory of DCC invigoration due to aerosol’s thermodynamic effect (additional latent heat release from freezing of greater amount of cloud water) may work during the growing stage, it is microphysical effect influenced by aerosols that drives the dramatic increase in cloud cover, cloud top height, and cloud thickness at the mature and dissipation stages by inducing larger amounts of smaller but longer-lasting ice particles in the stratiform/anvils of DCCs, even when thermodynamic invigoration of convection is absent. The thermodynamic invigoration effect contributes up to ∼27\% of total increase in cloud cover. The overall aerosol indirect effect is an atmospheric radiative warming (3–5 W⋅m−2) and a surface cooling (−5 to −8 W⋅m−2). The modeling findings are confirmed by the analyses of ample measurements made at three sites of distinctly different environments.},

	abstract = {A global multisensor satellite examination of aerosol indirect effects on warm oceanic clouds is presented. The study centers on the water path response of cloud to aerosol burden. A unique element of the study is a rigorous rain screening methodology that is utilized to separate the responses of nonraining and raining clouds. It is demonstrated that high aerosol environments are associated with reduced liquid water path in nonprecipitating clouds and that the reduction in liquid water path reduces the albedo enhancement expected from decreasing effective radius. Furthermore the reduction in liquid water path is greater in thermodynamically unstable environments than in stable environments suggesting a greater sensitivity of cumulus cloud than stratiform cloud liquid water path to aerosol. In sharp contrast with nonprecipitating clouds, the cloud liquid water path of transitional and precipitating clouds increases dramatically with aerosol, which may be indicative of an inhibited coalescence process. The evidence further indicates that increasing aerosol requires greater amounts of cloud condensate before the onset of precipitation. Additional support for this hypothesis is found in a reduction in the probability of precipitation by as much as 10\% depending on the thermodynamical state of the environment. Independent estimates of the broadband cloudy-sky albedo are used to confirm that the cloud albedo responds to the trends that are identified in the liquid water path. In particular, it is found that the water path effect dominates the cloud albedo response for precipitating and transitional clouds. Finally, regional analysis demonstrates that the magnitude of the relationship between aerosol and cloud albedo is greatest in the extratropics and subtropical stratus regions primarily in the winter hemisphere. These relationships are used to estimate the magnitude of the first indirect effect as −0.42 W/m2.},

	abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions have the potential to modify many different cloud properties. There is significant uncertainty in the strength of these aerosol-cloud interactions in analyses of observational data, partly due to the difficulty in separating aerosol effects on clouds from correlations generated by local meteorology. The relationship between aerosol and cloud fraction (CF) is particularly important to determine, due to the strong correlation of CF to other cloud properties and its large impact on radiation. It has also been one of the hardest to quantify from satellites due to the strong meteorological covariations involved. This work presents a new method to analyze the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and CF. By including information about the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the impact of the meteorological covariations is significantly reduced. This method shows that much of the AOD-CF correlation is explained by relationships other than that mediated by CDNC. By accounting for these, the strength of the global mean AOD-CF relationship is reduced by around 80\%. This suggests that the majority of the AOD-CF relationship is due to meteorological covariations, especially in the shallow cumulus regime. Requiring CDNC to mediate the AOD-CF relationship implies an effective anthropogenic radiative forcing from an aerosol influence on liquid CF of −0.48 W m−2 (−0.1 to −0.64 W m−2), although some uncertainty remains due to possible biases in the CDNC retrievals in broken cloud scenes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The dynamic structure of the weakly sheared atmospheric marine boundary layer (MBL) supports three distinct states of cloud cover, which are associated with the concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols in the MBL: (i) CCN rich MBL with closed Benard cellular convection that forms nearly full cloud cover; (ii) CCN depleted MBL with open cellular convection that forms \&lt;40\% cloud cover; and, (iii) CCN starved MBL where clouds cannot form due to insufficient CCN, with near zero cloud cover. Here we propose a mechanism for the transition between these three states that involves the aerosol impacts on precipitation and the feedbacks on the dynamics of the clouds and on the aerosols deposition. By suppressing precipitation aerosols can reverse the direction of the airflow, converting the cloud structure from open to closed cells and more than doubling the cloud cover. The three states possess positive feedbacks for self maintenance, so that small changes of the conditions can lead to bifurcation of the MBL cloud regime. The transition between the closed and open cells occur at near pristine background level of aerosols, creating a large sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to very small changes in aerosols at the MBL. The third state of super clean air can occur as the more efficient precipitation in cleaner air deposits the aerosols ever faster in a runaway positive feedback process. The proposed mechanism suggests that very small changes in the aerosols input to the MBL can have large impacts on the oceanic cloud cover and likely in turn on the global temperature, in ways that are not yet accounted for in the climate models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Documentation of the evolution of ship tracks during 42 h demonstrated that ship emissions are able to convert a marine stratocumulus regime of open cells into closed cells, along with significant negative radiative forcing. This was possible by examining continuous day and night geostationary satellite data that allowed for an uninterrupted documentation of the full life cycle of ship tracks. After nearly one day the ship tracks lost their linear appearance and expanded to cover large areas. These areas, when viewed out of sequence and context, would not be attributable to aerosol perturbations. A rejuvenation of previously dissipated ship tracks in the form of extensive closed cells was also observed. It is suggested that ship emissions may undergo photochemical reactions which nucleate new aerosols that, along with remaining ultrafine particles, grow to CCN that are activated hours later and close the open cells. The added radiative forcing from the closed cells that can be related to the ship tracks, which is mainly coming from the cloud cover effect, may exceed −100 Wm−2, depending on the season and latitude. This implies that anthropogenic aerosols that can be transported from continents through the boundary layer, or travel in the free troposphere and mix with the boundary layer from above, may explain the formation of large closed cells areas that are presently not recognized as originated by aerosol perturbations. The observations reported here pose a demanding test of the ability of cloud resolving models to replicate cloud-aerosol interactions.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations described in previous studies showed that adding cloud condensation nuclei to marine stratocumulus can prevent their breakup from closed into open cells. Additional analyses of the same simulations show that the suppression of rain is well described in terms of cloud drop effective radius (re). Rain is initiated when re near cloud top is around 12–14 μm. Cloud water starts to get depleted when column-maximum rain intensity (Rmax) exceeds 0.1 mm h−1. This happens when cloud-top re reaches 14 μm. Rmax is mostly less than 0.1 mm h−1 at re {\textless} 14 μm, regardless of the cloud water path, but increases rapidly when re exceeds 14 μm. This is in agreement with recent aircraft observations and theoretical studies in convective clouds so that the mechanism is not limited to describing marine stratocumulus. These results support the hypothesis that the onset of significant precipitation is determined by the number of nucleated cloud drops and the depth (D) above cloud base within the cloud that is required for cloud drops to reach re of 14 μm. In turn, this can explain the conditions for initiation of significant drizzle and opening of closed cells providing the basis for a simple parameterization for GCMs that unifies the representation of both precipitating and non-precipitating clouds as well as the transition between them. Furthermore, satellite global observations of cloud depth (from base to top), and cloud-top re can be used to derive and validate this parameterization.},

The nonlinearity of cloud-state changes to aerosol perturbations make it challenging to attribute causality in observed relationships of aerosol radiative forcing. Using correlations to infer causality can be challenging when meteorological variability also drives both aerosol and cloud changes independently. Natural and anthropogenic aerosol perturbations from well-defined sources provide “opportunistic experiments” (also known as natural experiments) to investigate ACI in cases where causality may be more confidently inferred. These perturbations cover a wide range of locations and spatiotemporal scales, including point sources such as volcanic eruptions or industrial sources, plumes from biomass burning or forest fires, and tracks from individual ships or shipping corridors. We review the different experimental conditions and conduct a synthesis of the available satellite datasets and field campaigns to place these opportunistic experiments on a common footing, facilitating new insights and a clearer understanding of key uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing. Cloud albedo perturbations are strongly sensitive to background meteorological conditions. Strong liquid water path increases due to aerosol perturbations are largely ruled out by averaging across experiments. Opportunistic experiments have significantly improved process-level understanding of ACI, but it remains unclear how reliably the relationships found can be scaled to the global level, thus demonstrating a need for deeper investigation in order to improve assessments of aerosol radiative forcing and climate change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates.},

A one-time adjustment to shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) TOA fluxes is made to ensure that global mean net TOA flux for July 2005–June 2015 is consistent with the in situ value of 0.71 W m−2. While global mean all-sky TOA flux differences between Ed4.0 and Ed2.8 are within 0.5 W m−2, appreciable SW regional differences occur over marine stratocumulus and snow/sea ice regions. Marked regional differences in SW clear-sky TOA flux occur in polar regions and dust areas over ocean. Clear-sky LW TOA fluxes in EBAF Ed4.0 exceed Ed2.8 in regions of persistent high cloud cover. Owing to substantial differences in global mean clear-sky TOA fluxes, the net cloud radiative effect in EBAF Ed4.0 is −18 W m−2 compared to −21 W m−2 in EBAF Ed2.8. The overall uncertainty in 1° × 1° latitude–longitude regional monthly all-sky TOA flux is estimated to be 3 W m−2 [one standard deviation (1σ)] for the Terra-only period and 2.5 W m−2 for the Terra–Aqua period both for SW and LW fluxes. The SW clear-sky regional monthly flux uncertainty is estimated to be 6 W m−2 for the Terra-only period and 5 W m−2 for the Terra–Aqua period. The LW clear-sky regional monthly flux uncertainty is 5 W m−2 for Terra only and 4.5 W m−2 for Terra–Aqua.},

	abstract = {Abstract Anomalously high reflectivity tracks in stratus and stratocumulus sheets associated with ships (known as ship tracks) are commonly seen in visible and near-infrared satellite imagery. Until now there have been only a limited number of in situ measurements made in ship tracks. The Monterey Area Ship Track (MAST) experiment, which was conducted off the coast of California in June 1994, provided a substantial dataset on ship emissions and their effects on boundary layer clouds. Several platforms, including the University of Washington C-131A aircraft, the Meteorological Research Flight C-130 aircraft, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ER-2 aircraft, the Naval Research Laboratory airship, the Research Vessel Glorita, and dedicated U.S. Navy ships, participated in MAST in order to study processes governing the formation and maintenance of ship tracks. This paper tests the hypotheses that the cloud microphysical changes that produce ship tracks are due to (a) particulate emission from the ship’s stack and/or (b) sea-salt particles from the ship’s wake. It was found that ships powered by diesel propulsion units that emitted high concentrations of aerosols in the accumulation mode produced ship tracks. Ships that produced few particles (such as nuclear ships), or ships that produced high concentrations of particles but at sizes too small to be activated as cloud drops in typical stratocumulus (such as gas turbine and some steam-powered ships), did not produce ship tracks. Statistics and case studies, combined with model simulations, show that provided a cloud layer is susceptible to an aerosol perturbation, and the atmospheric stability enables aerosol to be mixed throughout the boundary layer, the direct emissions of cloud condensation nuclei from the stack of a diesel-powered ship is the most likely, if not the only, cause of the formation of ship tracks. There was no evidence that salt particles from ship wakes cause ship tracks.},

Accurately quantifying this relationship from space is challenging due in part to contamination of aerosol statistics near clouds. Aerosol retrievals near clouds can be influenced by stray cloud particles in areas assumed to be cloud-free, particle swelling by humidification, shadows and enhanced scattering into the aerosol field from (3-D radiative transfer) clouds. To screen for this contamination we have developed a new cloud–aerosol pairing algorithm (CAPA) to link cloud observations to the nearest aerosol retrieval within the satellite image. The distance between each aerosol retrieval and nearest cloud is also computed in CAPA. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} Results from two independent satellite imagers, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), show a marked reduction in the strength of the intrinsic aerosol indirect radiative forcing when selecting aerosol pairs that are located farther away from the clouds (−0.28±0.26 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$) compared to those including pairs that are within 15 km of the nearest cloud (−0.49±0.18 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$). The larger aerosol optical depths in closer proximity to cloud artificially enhance the relationship between aerosol-loading, cloud albedo, and cloud fraction. These results suggest that previous satellite-based radiative forcing estimates represented in key climate reports may be exaggerated due to the inclusion of retrieval artefacts in the aerosol located near clouds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Those processes are manifest in a number of relationships that can be expressed as factors dlnX/dlnY driving aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcing. These factors include the relationships between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and emissions, droplet number and CCN concentration, cloud fraction and droplet number, cloud optical depth and droplet number, and cloud radiative forcing and cloud optical depth. The relationship between cloud optical depth and droplet number can be further decomposed into the sum of two terms involving the relationship of droplet effective radius and cloud liquid water path with droplet number. These relationships can be constrained using observations of recent spatial and temporal variability of these quantities. However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. Our analysis of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) model simulations suggests that estimates of relationships from recent variability are poor constraints on relationships from anthropogenic change for some terms, with even the sign of some relationships differing in many regions. Proxies connecting recent spatial/temporal variability to anthropogenic change, or sustained measurements in regions where emissions have changed, are needed to constrain estimates of anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {This study compares radiative fluxes and cloudiness fields from three general circulation models (the HadAM4 version of the Hadley Centre Unified model, cycle 16r2 of the ECMWF model and version LMDZ 2.0 of the LMD GCM), using a combination of satellite observations from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). To facilitate a meaningful comparison with the ISCCP C1 data, values of column cloud optical thickness and cloud top pressure are diagnosed from the models in a manner consistent with the satellite view from space. Decomposing the cloud radiative effect into contributions from low-medium- and high-level clouds reveals a tendency for the models' low-level clouds to compensate for underestimates in the shortwave cloud radiative effect caused by a lack of high-level or mid-level clouds. The low clouds fail to compensate for the associated errors in the longwave. Consequently, disproportionate errors in the longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effect in models may be taken as an indication that compensating errors are likely to be present. Mid-level cloud errors in the mid-latitudes appear to depend as much on the choice of the convection scheme as on the cloud scheme. Convective and boundary layer mixing schemes require as much consideration as cloud and precipitation schemes when it comes to assessing the simulation of clouds by models. Two distinct types of cloud feedback are discussed. While there is reason to doubt that current models are able to simulate potential `cloud regime' type feedbacks with skill, there is hope that a model capable of simulating potential `cloud amount' type feedbacks will be achievable once the reasons for the remaining differences between the models are understood.},

Ocean surface chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 1.77 mg/m3, and nINPs were a factor of 100 lower than historical surveys, ranging from 0.38 to 4.6 m−3 at −20 °C. The INP population included organic heat-stable material, with contributions from heat-labile material. Lower INP source potentials of SO seawater samples compared to Arctic seawater were consistent with lower ice nucleating site densities in this study compared to north Atlantic air masses.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We present a framework for estimating concentrations of episodically elevated high-temperature marine ice nucleating particles (INPs) in the sea surface microlayer and their subsequent emission into the atmospheric boundary layer. These episodic INPs have been observed in multiple ship-based and coastal field campaigns, but the processes controlling their ocean concentrations and transfer to the atmosphere are not yet fully understood. We use a combination of empirical constraints and simulation outputs from an Earth System Model to explore different hypotheses for explaining the variability of INP concentrations, and the occurrence of episodic INPs, in the marine atmosphere. In our calculations, we examine two proposed oceanic sources of high-temperature INPs: heterotrophic bacteria and marine biopolymer aggregates (MBPAs). Furthermore, we assume that the emission of these INPs is determined by the production of supermicron sea spray aerosol formed from jet drops, with an entrainment probability that is described by Poisson statistics. The concentration of jet drops is derived from the number concentration of supermicron sea spray aerosol calculated from model runs. We then derive the resulting number concentrations of marine high-temperature INPs (≥ 253 K) in the atmospheric boundary layer and compare their variability to atmospheric observations of INP variability. Specifically, we compare against concentrations of episodically occurring high-temperature INPs observed during field campaigns in the Southern Ocean, the Equatorial Pacific, and the North Atlantic. We find that heterotrophic bacteria and MBPAs acting as INPs provide only a partial explanation for the observed high INP concentrations. We note, however, that there are still substantial knowledge gaps, particularly concerning the identity of the oceanic INPs contributing most frequently to episodic high-temperature INPs, their specific ice nucleation activity, and the enrichment of their concentrations during the sea-air transfer process. Therefore, targeted measurements investigating the composition of these marine INPs as well as drivers for their emission are needed, ideally in combination with modeling studies focused on the potential cloud impacts of these high-temperature INPs.},

The US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) aircraft field campaign near the Azores islands provided ample observations of vertical distributions of aerosol and cloud properties. Here we utilize the in situ aircraft measurements from the ACE-ENA and ground-based remote-sensing data along with an aerosol-aware Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to characterize the aerosols due to long-range transport over a remote region and to assess their possible influence on marine-boundary-layer (MBL) clouds. The vertical profiles of aerosol and cloud properties measured via aircraft during the ACE-ENA campaign provide detailed information revealing the physical contact between transported aerosols and MBL clouds. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (ECMWF-CAMS) aerosol reanalysis data can reproduce the key features of aerosol vertical profiles in the remote region. The cloud-resolving WRF sensitivity experiments with distinctive aerosol profiles suggest that the transported aerosols and MBL cloud interactions (ACIs) require not only aerosol plumes to get close to the marine-boundary-layer top but also large cloud top height variations. Based on those criteria, the observations show that the occurrence of ACIs involving the transport of aerosol over the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) is about 62\&thinsp;\% in summer.

	abstract = {Abstract Emissions of particles, gases, heat, and water vapor from ships are discussed with respect to their potential for changing the microstructure of marine stratiform clouds and producing the phenomenon known as “ship tracks.” Airborne measurements are used to derive emission factors of SO2 and NO from diesel-powered and steam turbine-powered ships, burning low-grade marine fuel oil (MFO); they were ∼15–89 and ∼2–25 g kg−1 of fuel burned, respectively. By contrast a steam turbine–powered ship burning high-grade navy distillate fuel had an SO2 emission factor of ∼6 g kg−1. Various types of ships, burning both MFO and navy distillate fuel, emitted from ∼4 × 1015 to 2 × 1016 total particles per kilogram of fuel burned (∼4 × 1015–1.5 × 1016 particles per second). However, diesel-powered ships burning MFO emitted particles with a larger mode radius (∼0.03–0.05 μm) and larger maximum sizes than those powered by steam turbines burning navy distillate fuel (mode radius ∼0.02 μm). Consequently, if the particles have similar chemical compositions, those emitted by diesel ships burning MFO will serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at lower supersaturations (and will therefore be more likely to produce ship tracks) than the particles emitted by steam turbine ships burning distillate fuel. Since steam turbine–powered ships fueled by MFO emit particles with a mode radius similar to that of diesel-powered ships fueled by MFO, it appears that, for given ambient conditions, the type of fuel burned by a ship is more important than the type of ship engine in determining whether or not a ship will produce a ship track. However, more measurements are needed to test this hypothesis. The particles emitted from ships appear to be primarily organics, possibly combined with sulfuric acid produced by gas-to-particle conversion of SO2. Comparison of model results with measurements in ship tracks suggests that the particles from ships contain only about 10\% water-soluble materials. Measurements of the total particles entering marine stratiform clouds from diesel-powered ships fueled by MFO, and increases in droplet concentrations produced by these particles, show that only about 12\% of the particles serve as CCN. The fluxes of heat and water vapor from ships are estimated to be ∼2–22 MW and ∼0.5–1.5 kg s−1, respectively. These emissions rarely produced measurable temperature perturbations, and never produced detectable perturbations in water vapor, in the plumes from ships. Nuclear-powered ships, which emit heat but negligible particles, do not produce ship tracks. Therefore, it is concluded that heat and water vapor emissions do not play a significant role in ship track formation and that particle emissions, particularly from those burning low-grade fuel oil, are responsible for ship track formation. Subsequent papers in this special issue discuss and test these hypotheses.},

First, a training set is created by our team members manually labeling thousands of mesoscale (128 × 128) MODIS scenes into six different categories: stratus, closed cellular convection, disorganized convection, open cellular convection, clustered cumulus convection, and suppressed cumulus convection. Then we train a deep convolutional neural network model using this training set to classify individual MODIS scenes at 128 × 128 resolution and test it on a test set. The trained model achieves a cross-type average precision of about 93 \%. We apply the trained model to 16 years of data over the southeastern Paciﬁc. The resulting climatological distribution of low-cloud morphology types shows both expected and unexpected features and suggests promising potential for low-cloud studies as a data product.},

Small closed, large closed, and open cells were identified in about 65\% of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images during 2003. The MODIS imagery was combined with ceilometer and surface meteorological measurements, human observations of cloud types and drizzle, and large-scale meteorological analyses for January through June. The authors identified two drizzle regimes: a synoptically quiescent summer (January–March) regime characterized by a strong anticyclone, large closed cells, and frequent drizzle, and an autumn (April–June) regime characterized by a weaker anticyclone, small closed cells and open cells, and precipitation that was mainly associated with synoptic activity. The large closed cells had higher mean cloud bases and tops than the small closed cells and accounted for 45\% of the cumulus-under-stratocumulus reports and 29\% of the total drizzle and rain reports. Large closed cells occupied more intermittently coupled boundary layers than did the small closed cells. Open cells also occurred in more decoupled conditions but only accounted for 18\% of the total reports of drizzle and rain. The atmospheric stability of large and small closed cells was similar, but large closed cells were more commonly associated with a strong anticyclone, and small closed cells with wave activity superimposed upon a weakened anticyclone. The increased drizzle and occurrence of cumulus-under-stratocumulus in the summer rather than autumn is consistent with higher nighttime liquid water paths. A contribution of this study is the documentation of the ways in which synoptic activity can affect stratocumulus decks.},

While the tropical arm of AMO is responsible for many of these impacts, it is either too weak or completely absent in many climate model simulations. Here we show, using both observational and model evidence, that the radiative effect of positive low cloud and dust feedbacks is strong enough to generate the tropical arm of AMO, with the low cloud feedback more dominant. The feedbacks can be understood in a consistent dynamical framework: weakened tropical trade wind speed in response to a warm middle latitude SST anomaly reduces dust loading and low cloud fraction over the tropical Atlantic, which warms the tropical North Atlantic SST. Together they contribute to the appearance of the tropical arm of AMO. Most current climate models miss both the critical wind speed response and two positive feedbacks though realistic simulations of them may be essential for many climatic studies related to the AMO.},

	abstract = {African dust exhibits strong variability on a range of time scales. Here we show that the interhemispheric contrast in Atlantic SST (ICAS) drives African dust variability at decadal to millennial timescales, and the strong anthropogenic increase of the ICAS in the future will decrease African dust loading to a level never seen during the Holocene. We provide a physical framework to understand the relationship between the ICAS and African dust activity: positive ICAS anomalies push the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) northward and decrease surface wind speed over African dust source regions, which reduces dust emission and transport. It provides a unified framework for and is consistent with relationships in the literature. We find strong observational and proxy-record support for the ICAS-ITCZ-dust relationship during the past 160 and 17,000 years. Model-projected anthropogenic increase of the ICAS will reduce African dust by as much as 60\%, which has broad consequences.},

Precipitation is widely viewed as a key process important to POC development and maintenance. In this study, GOES-16 satellite observations are used in conjunction with MERRA-2 winds to track and compare the microphysical and environmental evolution of two populations of closed-cell StCu selected by visual inspection over the southeastern Pacific Ocean: one group that transitions to POCs and another comparison group (CLOSED) that does not. The high spatiotemporal resolution of the new GOES-16 data allows for a detailed examination of the temporal evolution of POCs in this region. We find that POCs tend to develop near the coast, last tens of hours, are larger than 10{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} km{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, and often (88 \% of cases) do not re-close before they exit the StCu deck. Most POCs are observed to form at night and tend to exit the StCu during the day when the StCu is contracting in area. Relative to the CLOSED trajectories, POCs have systematically larger effective radii, lower cloud drop number concentrations, a comparable conditional in-cloud liquid water path, and a higher frequency of more intense precipitation. Meanwhile, no systematic environmental differences other than boundary layer height are observed between POC and CLOSED trajectories. Interestingly, there are no differences in reanalysis aerosol optical depth between both sets of trajectories, which may lead one to the interpretation that differences in aerosol concentrations are not influencing POC development or resulting in a large number that re-close. However, this largely depends on the reanalysis treatment of aerosol–cloud interactions, and the product used in this study has no explicit handling of these important processes. These results support the consensus view regarding the importance of precipitation on the formation and maintenance of POCs and demonstrate the utility of modern geostationary remote sensing data in evaluating the POC life cycle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The classifier, used in prior studies, distinguishes closed, open, and cellular but disorganized MCC. This work uses trajectories in four eastern subtropical ocean basins to compare meteorological variables and the structures of boundary layers for trajectories that begin as closed cells but evolve into either open cells or disorganized cells or remain closed cells over one afternoon–afternoon cycle. Results show contrasts between the trajectory sets: Trajectories for MCC that remain closed cells are more frequently observed nearer coasts, whereas trajectories that break into open and disorganized cells begin farther offshore. The frequency at which closed cells transition to open cells is seasonally invariant. The fraction of trajectories that stay as closed MCC varies throughout the year in opposition to those that break into disorganized cells, so that their annual cycles are 180° out of phase. Trajectories remain as closed cell more frequently in austral spring and boreal summer when the trade inversion is stronger. The closed–disorganized MCC breakup is associated with weaker subsidence, a weaker inversion, a drier free troposphere, and enhanced nighttime boundary layer deepening, consistent with a warming–drying mechanism. The closed–open transition occurs in meteorological conditions similar to closed–closed trajectories. However, prior to the transition, the closed–open trajectories exhibit stronger surface winds and lower cloud droplet concentrations and rain more heavily overnight. Results suggest that multiple, independent mechanisms drive changes in cloud amount and morphology.},

These clouds, which contain both ice and supercooled water, respond to a warming world by transitioning to a state with more liquid water and a greater albedo, resulting in a negative “cloud-phase” climate feedback component. Here we argue that the magnitude of the negative cloud-phase feedback component depends on the amount and nature of the small fraction of aerosol particles that can nucleate ice crystals. We propose that a concerted research effort is required to reduce substantial uncertainties related to the poorly understood sources, concentration, seasonal cycles and nature of these ice-nucleating particles (INPs) and their rudimentary treatment in climate models. The topic is important because many climate models may have overestimated the magnitude of the cloud-phase feedback, and those with better representation of shallow oceanic clouds predict a substantially larger climate warming. We make the case that understanding the present-day INP population in shallow clouds in the cold sector of cyclone systems is particularly critical for defining present-day cloud phase and therefore how the clouds respond to warming. We also need to develop a predictive capability for future INP emissions and sinks in a warmer world with less ice and snow and potentially stronger INP sources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Generally, only clear-infrared spectral radiances (not affected by clouds) are assimilated in weather analysis systems. This is due to difficulties in modeling cloudy radiances as well as in observing their vertical structure from space. To take full advantage of the thermodynamic information in advanced infrared (IR) sounder observations requires assimilating radiances from cloud-contaminated regions. An optimal imager/sounder cloud-clearing technique has been developed by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This technique can be used to retrieve clear column radiances through combining collocated multiband imager IR clear radiances and the sounder cloudy radiances; no background information is needed in this method. The imager/sounder cloud-clearing technique is similar to that of the microwave/IR cloud clearing in the derivation of the clear-sky equivalent radiances. However, it retains the original IR sounder resolution, which is critical for regional numerical weather prediction applications. In this study, we have investigated the assimilation of cloud-cleared IR sounder radiances using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer for three hurricanes, Sandy (2012), Irene (2011), and Ike (2008). Results show that assimilating additional cloud-cleared AIRS radiances reduces the 48 and 72 h temperature forecast root-mean-square error by 0.1–0.3 K between 300 and 850 hPa. Substantial improvement in reducing track forecasts errors in the range of 10 km to 50 km was achieved.},

	abstract = {This article reviews developments towards assimilating cloud- and precipitation- affected satellite radiances at operational forecasting centres. Satellite data assimilation is moving beyond the “clear-sky” approach that discards any observations affected by cloud. Some centres already assimilate cloud- and precipitation-affected radiances operationally and the most popular approach is known as “all-sky,” which assimilates all observations directly as radiances, whether they are clear, cloudy or precipitating, using models (for both radiative transfer and forecasting) that are capable of simulating cloud and precipitation with sufficient accuracy. Other frameworks are being tried, including the assimilation of humidity retrieved from cloudy observations using Bayesian techniques. Although the all-sky technique is now proven for assimilation of microwave radiances, it has yet to be demonstrated operationally for infrared radiances, though several centres are getting close. Assimilating frequently available all-sky infrared observations from geostationary satellites could give particular benefit for short-range forecasting. More generally, assimilating cloud- and precipitation-affected satellite observations improves forecasts in the medium range globally and can also improve the analysis and shorter-range forecasting of otherwise poorly observed weather phenomena as diverse as tropical cyclones and wintertime low cloud.},

Here, we use multi-year observations from a very large array of robotic drifting floats in the Southern Ocean to determine key factors governing phytoplankton biomass dynamics over the annual cycle. Our analysis reveals seasonal phytoplankton accumulation (‘blooming’) events occurring during periods of declining modeled division rates, an observation that highlights the importance of loss processes in dictating the evolution of the seasonal cycle in biomass. In the open Southern Ocean, the spring bloom magnitude is found to be greatest in areas with high dissolved iron concentrations, consistent with iron being a well-established primary limiting nutrient in this region. Under ice observations show that biomass starts increasing in early winter, well before sea ice begins to retreat. The average theoretical sensitivity of the Southern Ocean to potential changes in seasonal nutrient and light availability suggests that a 10\% change in phytoplankton division rate may be associated with a 50\% reduction in mean bloom magnitude and annual primary productivity, assuming simple changes in the seasonal magnitude of phytoplankton division rates. Overall, our results highlight the importance of quantifying and accounting for both division and loss processes when modeling future changes in phytoplankton biomass cycles.},

However, when MCAOs are viewed as individual events regardless of horizontal extent, they occur more frequently in the SH. This is fundamentally because NH MCAOs are larger and stronger than those in the SH. MCAOs occur throughout the year, but in warm seasons and in the SH they are smaller and weaker than in cold seasons and in the NH. In both hemispheres, strong MCAOs occupy the cold air sector of midlatitude cyclones, which generally appear to be in their growth phase. Weak MCAOs in the SH occur under generally zonal flow with a slight northward component associated with weak zonal pressure gradients, while weak NH MCAOs occur under such a wide range of conditions that no characteristic synoptic pattern emerges from compositing. Strong boundary layer deepening, warming, and moistening occur as a result of the surface heat fluxes within MCAOs.},

	abstract = {Derived by combining data from the CloudSat radar and the CALIPSO lidar, the so-called radar-lidar geometrical profile product (RL-GeoProf) allows for characterization of the vertical and spatial structure of hydrometeor layers. RL-GeoProf is one of the standard data products of the CloudSat Project. In this paper we describe updates to the RL-GeoProf algorithm. These improvements include a significant fix to the CALIPSO Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) that more accurately renders the occurrence frequencies of low-level clouds over the global oceans. Additionally, we now account for the navigational challenges associated with coordinated measurements of the two instruments by providing additional diagnostic information in the data files. We also document how the along-track averaging of the VFM influences the accuracy of RL-GeoProf. We find that the 5 km averaged VFM when merged with data from the CloudSat radar provides a global description of cloud occurrence that best matches an independently derived cloud mask from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MYD35) over daytime global oceans. Expanding on the comparison with MYD35, we demonstrate that RL-GeoProf and MYD35 closely track the monthly averaged cloud occurrence fraction during a 4 year span of measurements. A more detailed examination reveals latitudinal dependency in the comparison. Specifically, MYD35 tends to be significantly low biased relative to RL-GeoProf over the Polar Regions when cloud layers present low visible and thermal contrast with underlying surfaces. Additional analyses examine the geometrically defined hydrometeor layer occurrence climatologies over select regions of the Earth and the seasonal variations of low-based and low-topped cloud cover.},

	abstract = {Stratocumulus clouds cover 20\% of the low-latitude oceans and are especially prevalent in the subtropics. They cool the Earth by shading large portions of its surface from sunlight. However, as their dynamical scales are too small to be resolvable in global climate models, predictions of their response to greenhouse warming have remained uncertain. Here we report how stratocumulus decks respond to greenhouse warming in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics in a representative subtropical region. In the simulations, stratocumulus decks become unstable and break up into scattered clouds when CO2 levels rise above 1,200 ppm. In addition to the warming from rising CO2 levels, this instability triggers a surface warming of about 8 K globally and 10 K in the subtropics. Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once CO2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred. Climate transitions that arise from this instability may have contributed importantly to hothouse climates and abrupt climate changes in the geological past. Such transitions to a much warmer climate may also occur in the future if CO2 levels continue to rise.},

We improved the representation of ship emissions in the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model, and compared simulated NO2 columns to consistent satellite observations. Relative differences between simulated and observed NO2 columns have been used to constrain ship emissions in four European seas (the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean Sea) using a mass-balance approach, and accounting for non-linear sensitivities to changing emissions in both model and satellite retrieval. These constraints are applied to 39 \% of total top-down European ship NOx emissions, which amount to 0.96 Tg N for 2005, and 1.0 Tg N for 2006 (11–15\% lower than the bottom-up EMEP ship emission inventory). Our results indicate that EMEP emissions in the Mediterranean Sea are too high (by 60\%) and misplaced by up to 150 km, which can have important consequences for local air quality simulations. In the North Sea ship track, our top-down emissions amount to 0.05 Tg N for 2005 (35\% lower than EMEP). Increased top-down emissions were found for the Baltic Sea and the Bay of Biscay ship tracks, with totals in these tracks of 0.05 Tg N (131\% higher than EMEP) and 0.08 Tg N for 2005 (128\% higher than EMEP), respectively. Our study explicitly accounts for the (non-linear) sensitivity of satellite retrievals to changes in the a priori NO2 profiles, as satellite observations are never fully independent of model information (i.e. assumptions on vertical NO2 profiles). Our study provides for the first time a space-based, top-down ship NOx emission inventory, and can serve as a framework for future studies to constrain ship emissions using satellite NO2 observations in other seas.},

	abstract = {Marine low clouds of the busy shipping lane in the southeast Atlantic during the springs of 2003–2015 were analyzed to study the dependence of their properties and radiative forcing on the background cloud drop concentrations (Nd-bg). The overall average cloud radiative effect within the shipping lane was larger by only −1 Wm−2 compared to the adjacent clouds. However, this near-zero averaged effect was composed of large negative cloud radiative forcing (CRF) for the cleanest (13\%) of the cases with Nd-bg {\textless} 50 cm−3, which was almost neutralized by a positive CRF for the 40\% of the cases with Nd-bg {\textgreater} 70 cm−3. A possible explanation for this positive forcing is the cloud burning effect of the black carbon from ship emissions. The negative forcing was composed of 45\% for the cloud fraction (Cf) effect and 55\% for the albedo effects, which included a small contribution of the liquid water path (LWP) effect. Positive Cf susceptibility to Nd-core was at maximum for the lowest Nd-bg and disappeared near 60 cm−3. The albedo susceptibility to Nd-core reached its theoretical limit of 1/3 for constant LWP when Nd-bg {\textless}40 cm−3, and diminishes to 0.2 when Nd-bg = 60 cm−3. These susceptibilities represent cause and effect relationships because the differences of aerosols caused by the ship emissions vary at a much smaller scale than meteorology. Globally, under similar environmental conditions, nearly half of the area has Nd {\textless} 50 cm−3, thus possessing the indicated large susceptibility of negative radiative forcing to anthropogenic aerosols.},

	abstract = {Subkilometer processes are critical to the physics of aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) but have been dependent on parameterizations in global model simulations. We thus report the strength of ACI in the Ultra-Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (UPCAM), a multiscale climate model that uses coarse exterior resolution to embed explicit cloud-resolving models with enough resolution (250 m horizontal, 20 m vertical) to quasi-resolve subkilometer eddies. To investigate the impact on ACIs, UPCAM's simulations are compared to a coarser multiscale model with 4 km horizontal resolution. UPCAM produces cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) and cloud liquid water path (LWP) values that are higher than the coarser model but equally plausible compared to observations. Our analysis focuses on the Northern Hemisphere (20–50°N) oceans, where historical aerosol increases have been largest. We find similarities in the overall radiative forcing from ACIs in the two models, but this belies fundamental underlying differences. The radiative forcing from increases in LWP is weaker in UPCAM, whereas the forcing from increases in Nd is larger. Surprisingly, the weaker LWP increase is not due to a weaker increase in LWP in raining clouds, but a combination of weaker increase in LWP in nonraining clouds and a smaller fraction of raining clouds in UPCAM. The implication is that as global modeling moves toward finer than storm-resolving grids, nuanced model validation of ACI statistics conditioned on the existence of precipitation and good observational constraints on the baseline probability of precipitation will become key for tighter constraints and better conceptual understanding.},

Large volcanic eruptions produce sulfur dioxide, which in turn produces aerosols; these eruptions thus represent a natural experiment through which to quantify aerosol–cloud interactions. Here we show that the massive 2014–2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud droplets—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible effect on other cloud properties. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and global-mean radiative forcing of around −0.2 watts per square metre for September to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however, were undetectable, indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in general, are well buffered against aerosol changes. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because we are now able to reject results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud interactions have a potentially large impact on climate but are poorly quantified and thus contribute a substantial and long-standing uncertainty in climate projections. The impacts derived from climate models are poorly constrained by observations because retrieving robust large-scale signals of aerosol–cloud interactions is frequently hampered by the considerable noise associated with meteorological co-variability. The 2014 Holuhraun effusive eruption in Iceland resulted in a massive aerosol plume in an otherwise near-pristine environment and thus provided an ideal natural experiment to quantify cloud responses to aerosol perturbations. Here we disentangle significant signals from the noise of meteorological co-variability using a satellite-based machine-learning approach. Our analysis shows that aerosols from the eruption increased cloud cover by approximately 10\%, and this appears to be the leading cause of climate forcing, rather than cloud brightening as previously thought. We find that volcanic aerosols do brighten clouds by reducing droplet size, but this has a notably smaller radiative impact than changes in cloud fraction. These results add substantial observational constraints on the cooling impact of aerosols. Such constraints are critical for improving climate models, which still inadequately represent the complex macro-physical and microphysical impacts of aerosol–cloud interactions.},

We address this uncertainty by employing a bottom-up estimate of fuel consumption and vessel activity for internationally registered fleets, including cargo vessels, other commercial vessels, and military vessels. We identify model bias in previous work, which assumed internationally registered ships primarily consume international marine fuels. Updated results suggest fuel consumption is ∼289 million metric tons per year, more than twice the quantity reported as international fuel. According to our analysis, fuel used by internationally registered fleets is apparently allocated to both international and domestic fuel statistics; this implies either that ships operate along domestic routes much of the time or that marine fuel sales to these ships may be misassigned. If the former is true, then allocation of emissions to international shipping routes may underestimate near-coastal emissions from ships. Our updated inventories increases previous ship emissions inventories for all pollutants; for example, global NOx emissions (∼6.87 Tg N) are more than doubled. This work also produces detailed sensitivity analyses of inputs to these estimates, identifying uncertainty in vessel duty-cycle as critical to overall emissions estimates. We discuss implications for assessing ship emissions impacts.},

We quantify ship emissions scenarios which are expected to increase as declining sea ice coverage due to climate change allows for increased shipping activity in the Arctic. A first-order calculation of global warming potential due to 2030 emissions in the high-growth scenario suggests that short-lived forcing of {\textasciitilde}4.5 gigagrams of black carbon from Arctic shipping may increase global warming potential due to Arctic ships' CO2 emissions ({\textasciitilde}42 000 gigagrams) by some 17\% to 78\%.

	abstract = {Global surface emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) over a 10-year period (2005\&ndash;2014) are estimated from an assimilation of multiple satellite data sets: tropospheric NO2 columns from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY), O3 profiles from Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), CO profiles from Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), and O3 and HNO3 profiles from Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) using an ensemble Kalman filter technique. Chemical concentrations of various species and emission sources of several precursors are simultaneously optimized. This is expected to improve the emission inversion because the emission estimates are influenced by biases in the modelled tropospheric chemistry, which can be partly corrected by also optimizing the concentrations. We present detailed distributions of the estimated emission distributions for all major regions, the diurnal and seasonal variability, and the evolution of these emissions over the 10-year period. The estimated regional total emissions show a strong positive trend over India (+29 \% decade−1), China (+26 \% decade−1), and the Middle East (+20 \% decade−1), and a negative trend over the USA (−38 \% decade−1), southern Africa (−8.2 \% decade−1), and western Europe (−8.8 \% decade−1). The negative trends in the USA and western Europe are larger during 2005\&ndash;2010 relative to 2011\&ndash;2014, whereas the trend in China becomes negative after 2011. The data assimilation also suggests a large uncertainty in anthropogenic and fire-related emission factors and an important underestimation of soil NOx sources in the emission inventories. Despite the large trends observed for individual regions, the global total emission is almost constant between 2005 (47.9 Tg N yr−1) and 2014 (47.5 Tg N yr−1).},

In this study, we map NOx emissions on high spatial resolution from TROPOMI observations of NO2 combined with wind fields based on the continuity equation. The divergence of horizontal fluxes proves to be highly sensitive for point sources like exhaust stacks. Thus, NOx emissions from individual power plants can be resolved and quantified even on top of considerably high urban pollution from the Saudi Arabian capital city Riyadh. This allows us to catalog NOx emissions from large point sources globally, as demonstrated for South Africa and Germany, with a detection limit of about 0.11 kg/s down to 0.03 kg/s for ideal conditions.},

	abstract = {New high quality satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over snow-covered regions of Siberia reveal previously undocumented but significant NO2 emissions associated with the natural gas industry in Western Siberia. Besides gas drilling and natural gas power plants, also gas compressor stations for the transport of natural gas are sources of high amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), which are emitted in otherwise pristine regions. The emissions per station from these remote gas compressor stations are at least an order of magnitude larger than those reported for North American gas compressor stations, possibly related to less stringent environmental regulations in Siberia compared to the United States. This discovery was made possible thanks to a newly developed technique for discriminating snow covered surfaces from clouds, which allows for satellite measurements of tropospheric NO2 columns over large boreal snow-covered areas. While retrievals over snow-covered areas were traditionally filtered out, we used the retrieved column of air in these observations to distinguish clouds higher in the atmosphere from the snow at the surface. This results in 23\% more TROPOMI observations on an annual basis. Furthermore, these observations have a precision four times better than nearly any TROPOMI observation over other areas and surfaces around the world. These new results highlight the potential of TROPOMI on Sentinel 5P as well as future satellite missions for monitoring small-scale emissions and emissions at high latitudes.},

	abstract = {We present a new and improved version (V4.0) of the NASA standard nitrogen dioxide (NO2) product from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite. This version incorporates the most salient improvements for OMI NO2 products suggested by expert users and enhances the NO2 data quality in several ways through improvements to the air mass factors (AMFs) used in the retrieval algorithm. The algorithm is based on the geometry-dependent surface Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (GLER) operational product that is available on an OMI pixel basis. GLER is calculated using the vector linearized discrete ordinate radiative transfer (VLIDORT) model, which uses as input high-resolution bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) information from NASA's Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments over land and the wind-dependent Cox–Munk wave-facet slope distribution over water, the latter with a contribution from the water-leaving radiance. The GLER combined with consistently retrieved oxygen dimer (O2–O2) absorption-based effective cloud fraction (ECF) and optical centroid pressure (OCP) provide improved information to the new NO2 AMF calculations. The new AMFs increase the retrieved tropospheric NO2 by up to 50 \% in highly polluted areas; these differences arise from both cloud and surface BRDF effects as well as biases between the new MODIS-based and previously used OMI-based climatological surface reflectance data sets. We quantitatively evaluate the new NO2 product using independent observations from ground-based and airborne instruments. The new V4.0 data and relevant explanatory documentation are publicly available from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OMNO2\_V003/summary/, last access: 8 November 2020), and we encourage their use over previous versions of OMI NO2 products.},

	abstract = {Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.

	abstract = {This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75\%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8\%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.},

SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3\% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2\% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0\% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C. Code will be released at: github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer.},

Previous work has found a substantial decrease in the detection of ship tracks in clouds after the IMO 2020 regulations went into effect, but changes in large-scale cloud properties have been more equivocal. Using a statistical technique that estimates counterfactual fields of what large-scale cloud and radiative properties within an isolated shipping corridor in the southeastern Atlantic would have been in the absence of shipping, we confidently detect a reduction in the magnitude of cloud droplet effective radius decreases within the shipping corridor and find evidence for a reduction in the magnitude of cloud brightening as well. The instantaneous radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions from the IMO 2020 regulations is estimated as O(1 W m−2) within the shipping corridor, lending credence to global estimates of O(0.1 W m−2). In addition to their geophysical significance, our results also provide independent evidence for general compliance with the IMO 2020 regulations.},

	abstract = {Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol-driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed-phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68\% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of -1.6 to -0.6 W m−2, or -2.0 to -0.4 W m−2 with a 90\% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial-era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds.},

Using existing U.S. military fighter and tanker planes, the annual costs of injecting aerosol precursors into the lower stratosphere would be several billion dollars. Using artillery or balloons to loft the gas would be much more expensive. We do not have enough information to evaluate more exotic techniques, such as pumping the gas up through a hose attached to a tower or balloon system. Anthropogenic stratospheric aerosol injection would cool the planet, stop the melting of sea ice and land-based glaciers, slow sea level rise, and increase the terrestrial carbon sink, but produce regional drought, ozone depletion, less sunlight for solar power, and make skies less blue. Furthermore it would hamper Earth-based optical astronomy, do nothing to stop ocean acidification, and present many ethical and moral issues.

	abstract = {The idea behind the marine cloud-brightening (MCB) geoengineering technique is that seeding marine stratocumulus clouds with copious quantities of roughly monodisperse sub-micrometre sea water particles might significantly enhance the cloud droplet number concentration, and thereby the cloud albedo and possibly longevity. This would produce a cooling, which general circulation model (GCM) computations suggest could—subject to satisfactory resolution of technical and scientific problems identified herein—have the capacity to balance global warming up to the carbon dioxide-doubling point. We describe herein an account of our recent research on a number of critical issues associated with MCB. This involves (i) GCM studies, which are our primary tools for evaluating globally the effectiveness of MCB, and assessing its climate impacts on rainfall amounts and distribution, and also polar sea-ice cover and thickness; (ii) high-resolution modelling of the effects of seeding on marine stratocumulus, which are required to understand the complex array of interacting processes involved in cloud brightening; (iii) microphysical modelling sensitivity studies, examining the influence of seeding amount, seed-particle salt-mass, air-mass characteristics, updraught speed and other parameters on cloud–albedo change; (iv) sea water spray-production techniques; (v) computational fluid dynamics studies of possible large-scale periodicities in Flettner rotors; and (vi) the planning of a three-stage limited-area field research experiment, with the primary objectives of technology testing and determining to what extent, if any, cloud albedo might be enhanced by seeding marine stratocumulus clouds on a spatial scale of around 100×100 km. We stress that there would be no justification for deployment of MCB unless it was clearly established that no significant adverse consequences would result. There would also need to be an international agreement firmly in favour of such action.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that changes in solar radiation affect the hydrological cycle more strongly than equivalent CO2 changes for the same change in global mean surface temperature. Thus, solar radiation management “geoengineering” proposals to completely offset global mean temperature increases by reducing the amount of absorbed sunlight might be expected to slow the global water cycle and reduce runoff over land. However, proposed countering of global warming by increasing the albedo of marine clouds would reduce surface solar radiation only over the oceans. Here, for an idealized scenario, we analyze the response of temperature and the hydrological cycle to increased reflection by clouds over the ocean using an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. When cloud droplets are reduced in size over all oceans uniformly to offset the temperature increase from a doubling of atmospheric CO2, the global-mean precipitation and evaporation decreases by about 1.3\% but runoff over land increases by 7.5\% primarily due to increases over tropical land. In the model, more reflective marine clouds cool the atmospheric column over ocean. The result is a sinking motion over oceans and upward motion over land. We attribute the increased runoff over land to this increased upward motion over land when marine clouds are made more reflective. Our results suggest that, in contrast to other proposals to increase planetary albedo, offsetting mean global warming by reducing marine cloud droplet size does not necessarily lead to a drying, on average, of the continents. However, we note that the changes in precipitation, evaporation and P-E are dominated by small but significant areas, and given the highly idealized nature of this study, a more thorough and broader assessment would be required for proposals of altering marine cloud properties on a large scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract This is the first part of a series of two articles analyzing the global thermal properties of atmosphere–ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs) within the framework of a two-layer energy-balance model (EBM). In this part, the general analytical solution of the system is given and two idealized climate change scenarios, one with a step forcing and one with a linear forcing, are discussed. These solutions give a didactic description of the contributions from the equilibrium response and of the fast and slow transient responses during a climate transition. Based on these analytical solutions, a simple and physically based procedure to calibrate the two-layer model parameters using an AOGCM step-forcing experiment is introduced. Using this procedure, the global thermal properties of 16 AOGCMs participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are determined. It is shown that, for a given AOGCM, the EBM tuned with only the abrupt 4×CO2 experiment is able to reproduce with a very good accuracy the temperature evolution in both a step-forcing and a linear-forcing experiment. The role of the upper-ocean and deep-ocean heat uptakes in the fast and slow responses is also discussed. One of the main weaknesses of the simple EBM discussed in this part is its ability to represent the evolution of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance in the transient regime. This issue is addressed in Part II by taking into account the efficacy factor of deep-ocean heat uptake.},

The Köhler theory is used to relate the aerosol size distribution and composition to the number activated as a function of maximum supersaturation. The supersaturation balance is used to determine the maximum supersaturation, accounting for particle growth both before and after the particles are activated. Comparison of the parameterized activation of two competing aerosol modes with detailed numerical simulations of the activation process yields agreement to within 10\% under a wide variety of conditions, including diverse size distributions, number concentrations, compositions, and updraft velocities. The parametization error exceeds 10\% only when the mode radius of the two size distributions differs by an order of magnitude. Errors for the mass fraction activated are always much less than errors for the number fraction activated.},

We improve upon existing inventories with a more consistent and reproducible methodology applied to all emission species, updated emission factors, and recent estimates through 2014. The data system relies on existing energy consumption data sets and regional and country-specific inventories to produce trends over recent decades. All emission species are consistently estimated using the same activity data over all time periods. Emissions are provided on an annual basis at the level of country and sector and gridded with monthly seasonality. These estimates are comparable to, but generally slightly higher than, existing global inventories. Emissions over the most recent years are more uncertain, particularly in low- and middle-income regions where country-specific emission inventories are less available. Future work will involve refining and updating these emission estimates, estimating emissions' uncertainty, and publication of the system as open-source software.},

Here, using national mobility data, we estimate global emission reductions for ten species during the period February to June 2020. We estimate that global NOx emissions declined by as much as 30\% in April, contributing a short-term cooling since the start of the year. This cooling trend is offset by {\textasciitilde}20\% reduction in global SO2 emissions that weakens the aerosol cooling effect, causing short-term warming. As a result, we estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01 ± 0.005 °C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies. In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3 °C by 2050.},

EEI is set by natural and anthropogenic climate forcings and the climate system's response to those forcings. It is also influenced by internal variations within the climate system. Most of EEI warms the ocean; the remainder heats the land, melts ice, and warms the atmosphere. We show that independent satellite and in situ observations each yield statistically indistinguishable decadal increases in EEI from mid-2005 to mid-2019 of 0.50 ± 0.47 W m−2 decade−1 (5\%–95\% confidence interval). This trend is primarily due to an increase in absorbed solar radiation associated with decreased reflection by clouds and sea-ice and a decrease in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) due to increases in trace gases and water vapor. These changes combined exceed a positive trend in OLR due to increasing global mean temperatures.},

Increased aerosol concentrations due to human activity affect droplet number concentration, liquid water and cloud fraction2, but these changes are subject to large uncertainties3. Ship tracks, long lines of polluted clouds that are visible in satellite images, are one of the main tools for quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions4. However, only a small fraction of the clouds polluted by shipping show ship tracks5,6. Here we show that even when no ship tracks are visible in satellite images, aerosol emissions change cloud properties substantially. We develop a new method to quantify the effect of shipping on all clouds, showing a cloud droplet number increase and a more positive liquid water response when there are no visible tracks. We directly detect shipping-induced cloud property changes in the trade cumulus regions of the Atlantic, which are known to display almost no visible tracks. Our results indicate that previous studies of ship tracks were suffering from selection biases by focusing only on visible tracks from satellite imagery. The strong liquid water path response we find translates to a larger aerosol cooling effect on the climate, potentially masking a higher climate sensitivity than observed temperature trends would otherwise suggest.},

We performed an integrated analysis of NASA GEOS model simulations run with the GOCART aerosol module, in situ measurements from the PALMS and SAGA instruments obtained during the NASA ATom campaign, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from the AERONET Marine Aerosol Network (MAN) and from MODIS satellite observations to better constrain sea salt in the marine atmosphere. ATom measurements and GEOS model simulations both show that sea salt concentrations over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans have a strong vertical gradient, varying up to 4 orders of magnitude from the marine boundary layer to free troposphere. The modeled residence times suggest that the lifetime of sea salt particles with a dry diameter of less than 3\&thinsp;µm is largely controlled by wet removal, followed by turbulent process. During both boreal summer and winter, the GEOS-simulated sea salt mass mixing ratios agree with SAGA measurements in the marine boundary layer (MBL) and with PALMS measurements above the MBL. However, comparison of AOD from GEOS with AERONET/MAN and MODIS aerosol retrievals indicated that the model underestimated AOD over the oceans where sea salt dominates. The apparent discrepancy of slightly overpredicted concentration and large underpredicted AOD could not be explained by biases in the model RH affecting the particle hygroscopic growth, as modeled RH was found to be comparable to or larger than the in situ measurements. This conundrum could at least partially be explained by the difference in sea salt size distribution; the GEOS simulation has much less sea salt percentage-wise in the smaller particle size range and thus less efficient light extinction than what was observed by PALMS.},

	abstract = {Near-term climate forcers (NTCFs) can influence climate via interaction with the Earth's radiative balance and include both aerosols and trace gas constituents of the atmosphere (such as methane and ozone). Two of the principal NTCFs, aerosols (particulate matter) and tropospheric ozone (O3), can also affect local air quality when present in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Previous studies have shown that mitigation of NTCFs has the potential to improve air quality and reduce the rate of surface warming induced by long-lived greenhouse gases. Here, we assess the combined air quality and climate impacts from changes in NTCFs under numerous different future mitigation scenarios, relative to a future reference scenario, that were conducted by a single Earth system model (UKESM1) as part of the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). Co-benefits to both global air quality and climate are only achieved in the future scenario with strong mitigation measures applied to all NTCFs, particularly aerosols and methane, with penalties identified for inaction. When compared to the combined NTCF mitigation scenario, analysis of individual mitigation scenarios shows that there are important non-linearities and interactions between NTCFs (e.g., aerosols and clouds). If only aerosol components are mitigated, there are still benefits to air quality but detrimental impacts on climate, particularly at the regional scale. In addition, other changes in future land-use and climate could have important impacts on regional NTCFs, which should be considered when designing future mitigation measures to anthropogenic emissions.},

	abstract = {Climate change is creating impacts that are widespread and severe for individuals, communities, economies, and ecosystems around the world.  While efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate impacts are the first line of defense, researchers are exploring other options to reduce warming. Solar geoengineering strategies are designed to cool Earth either by adding small reflective particles to the upper atmosphere, by increasing reflective cloud cover in the lower atmosphere, or by thinning high-altitude clouds that can absorb heat. While such strategies have the potential to reduce global temperatures, they could also introduce an array of unknown or negative consequences.
This report concludes that a strategic investment in research is needed to enhance policymakers' understanding of climate response options. The United States should develop a transdisciplinary research program, in collaboration with other nations, to advance understanding of solar geoengineering's technical feasibility and effectiveness, possible impacts on society and the environment, and social dimensions such as public perceptions, political and economic dynamics, and ethical and equity considerations.  The program should operate under robust research governance that includes such elements as a research code of conduct, a public registry for research, permitting systems for outdoor experiments, guidance on intellectual property, and inclusive public and stakeholder engagement processes.},

In the scientific literature, the most prominent climate intervention proposal is that of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), although proposals for marine cloud brightening (MCB) have also received considerable attention. In this study, we design a new MCB experiment (G6MCB) for the UKESM1 Earth system model which follows the same baseline and cooling scenarios as the well-documented G6sulfur SAI scenario developed by the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) and compare the results from G6MCB with those from G6sulfur. The deployment strategy used in G6MCB injects sea-salt aerosol into four cloudy areas of the eastern Pacific. Despite MCB being intended as a technique to modify clouds, much of the radiative effect in G6MCB is found to derive from the direct interaction of the injected sea-salt aerosols with solar radiation. The results show that while G6MCB can achieve its target in terms of reducing high-end global warming to moderate levels, there are several side-effects. Some are common to SAI, including overcooling of the tropics, and residual warming of mid-and high latitudes. Others side effects specific to common choices of MCB regions include changes in monsoon precipitation, year-round increases in precipitation over Australia and the maritime continent and increased sea-level rise around western Australia and the maritime continent; these results are all consistent with a permanent and very strong La Ni\&ntilde;a-like response being induced in G6MCB. It should be stressed that the results are extremely dependent upon the strategy chosen for MCB deployment. As demonstrated by the development of SAI strategies which can achieve multiple temperature targets and ameliorate some of the residual impacts of climate change, much further work is required in multiple models to obtain a robust understanding of the practical scope, limitations, perils and pitfalls of any proposed MCB deployment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {To counteract global warming, there have been suggestions to increase the albedo of low-level marine clouds through the aerosol indirect effects by injecting them with sea salt. However, the full climate response to this geoengineering scheme is currently poorly understood. We simulate cloud seeding in a coupled mixed-layer ocean-atmosphere general circulation model in order to identify the specific physical mechanisms through which seeding could perturb the climate system's radiative balance, and cause temperature and precipitation changes. Seeding stratocumulus decks over three tropical maritime regions in the North Pacific, South Pacific and South Atlantic produces strong local reductions in solar absorption. Over half of the radiative cooling is due to direct scattering of solar radiation by the added sea salt aerosols, while the rest comes from enhancement of the local cloud albedo. The oceanic cooling due to the seeding over the southeastern equatorial Pacific induces a La Niña-like response, with tropical precipitation changes resembling La Niña anomalies and teleconnections occurring in the mid-latitude North Pacific and North America. Additionally, model runs in which only one of the three regions is seeded indicate nonlinearity in the climate response. We identify dynamical and thermodynamical constraints respectively on the temperature and hydrological cycle responses to cloud seeding, but the full response to such geoengineering remains poorly constrained.},

Consistent analysis of temperature over the full Cenozoic era—including ‘slow’ feedbacks by ice sheets and trace gases—supports this sensitivity and implies that CO2 was 300–350 ppm in the Pliocene and about 450 ppm at transition to a nearly ice-free planet, exposing unrealistic lethargy of ice sheet models. Equilibrium global warming for today’s GHG amount is 10°C, which is reduced to 8°C by today’s human-made aerosols. Equilibrium warming is not ‘committed’ warming; rapid phaseout of GHG emissions would prevent most equilibrium warming from occurring. However, decline of aerosol emissions since 2010 should increase the 1970–2010 global warming rate of 0.18°C per decade to a post-2010 rate of at least 0.27°C per decade. Thus, under the present geopolitical approach to GHG emissions, global warming will exceed 1.5°C in the 2020s and 2°C before 2050. Impacts on people and nature will accelerate as global warming increases hydrologic (weather) extremes. The enormity of consequences demands a return to Holocene-level global temperature. Required actions include: (1) a global increasing price on GHG emissions accompanied by development of abundant, affordable, dispatchable clean energy, (2) East-West cooperation in a way that accommodates developing world needs, and (3) intervention with Earth’s radiation imbalance to phase down today’s massive human-made ‘geo-transformation’ of Earth’s climate.

However, as analysis of model behavior has become more detailed, shortcomings and ambiguities in the framework have become more evident, and physical effects unaccounted for by the traditional framework have become interesting. In particular, the new concept of adjustments, which are responses to forcings that are not mediated by the global-mean temperature, has emerged. This concept, related to the older ones of climate efficacy and stratospheric adjustment, is a more physical way of capturing unique responses to specific forcings. We present a pedagogical review of the adjustment concept, why it is important, and how it can be used. The concept is particularly useful for aerosols, where it helps to organize what has become a complex array of forcing mechanisms. It also helps clarify issues around cloud and hydrological response, transient versus equilibrium climate change, and geoengineering.},

This paper addresses a substantial extension of the modelling system, to allow also for the mass-based emissions of particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO). The presented Ship Traffic Emissions Assessment Model (STEAM2) allows for the influences of accurate travel routes and ship speed, engine load, fuel sulphur content, multiengine setups, abatement methods and waves. We address in particular the modeling of the influence on the emissions of both engine load and the sulphur content of the fuel. The presented methodology can be used to evaluate the total PM emissions, and those of organic carbon, elemental carbon, ash and hydrated sulphate. We have evaluated the performance of the extended model against available experimental data on engine power, fuel consumption and the composition-resolved emissions of PM. We have also compared the annually averaged emission values with those of the corresponding EMEP inventory, As example results, the geographical distributions of the emissions of PM and CO are presented for the marine regions of the Baltic Sea surrounding the Danish Straits.},

We have improved the model regarding (i) the evaluation of the missing technical specifications of ships, and (ii) the treatment of shipping activities in case of sparse satellite AIS-data. We have developed a model for the collection and processing of available information on the technical specifications, using data assimilation techniques. We have also developed a path regeneration model that constructs, whenever necessary, the detailed geometry of the ship routes. The presented results for fuel consumption were qualitatively in agreement both with those in the 3rd Greenhouse Gas Study of the International Maritime Organisation and those reported by the International Energy Agency. We have also presented high-resolution global spatial distributions of the shipping emissions of NOx, CO2, SO2 and PM2.5. The emissions were also analysed in terms of selected sea areas, ship categories, the sizes of ships and flag states. The emission datasets provided by this study are available upon request; the datasets produced by the model can be utilized as input data for air quality modelling on a global scale, including the full temporal and spatial variation of shipping emissions for the first time. Dispersion modelling using this inventory as input can be used to assess the impacts of various emission abatement scenarios.

Here, using the high-resolution forecast-oriented low ocean resolution (HiFLOR) model—which resolves tropical cyclones and has an improved representation of present-day precipitation extremes11,12—alongside 12 models from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), we analyse the fraction of locations that see their local climate change exacerbated or moderated by SG. Rather than restoring temperatures, we assume that SG is applied to halve the warming produced by doubling CO2 (half-SG). In HiFLOR, half-SG offsets most of the CO2-induced increase of simulated tropical cyclone intensity. Moreover, neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-SG when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes (SREX) region. Indeed, for both extreme precipitation and water availability, less than 0.4\% of the ice-free land surface sees exacerbation. Thus, while concerns about the inequality of solar geoengineering impacts are appropriate, the quantitative extent of inequality may be overstated13.},

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols and their impact on cloud properties remain the largest uncertainty in the human forcing of the climate system. By increasing the concentration of cloud droplets (Nd), aerosols reduce droplet size and increase the reflectivity of clouds (a negative radiative forcing). Central to this climate impact is the susceptibility of cloud droplet number to aerosol (β), the diversity of which explains much of the variation in the radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions (RFaci) in global climate models. This has made measuring β a key target for developing observational constraints of the aerosol forcing.

 While the aerosol burden of the clean, pre-industrial atmosphere has been demonstrated as a key uncertainty for the aerosol forcing, here we show that the behaviour of clouds under these clean conditions is of equal importance for understanding the spread in radiative forcing estimates between models and observations. This means that the uncertainty in the aerosol impact on clouds is, counterintuitively, driven by situations with little aerosol. Discarding clean conditions produces a close agreement between different model and observational estimates of the cloud response to aerosol but does not provide a strong constraint on the RFaci. This makes constraining aerosol behaviour in clean conditions an important goal for future observational studies.},

	abstract = {The atmospheric Green's function method is a technique for modeling the response of the atmosphere to changes in the spatial field of surface temperature. While early studies applied this method to changes in atmospheric circulation, it has also become an important tool to understand changes in radiative feedbacks due to evolving patterns of warming, a phenomenon called the “pattern effect.” To better study this method, this paper presents a protocol for creating atmospheric Green's functions to serve as the basis for a model intercomparison project, GFMIP. The protocol has been developed using a series of sensitivity tests performed with the HadAM3 atmosphere-only general circulation model, along with existing and new simulations from other models. Our preliminary results have uncovered nonlinearities in the response of the atmosphere to surface temperature changes, including an asymmetrical response to warming versus cooling patch perturbations, and a change in the dependence of the response on the magnitude and size of the patches. These nonlinearities suggest that the pattern effect may depend on the heterogeneity of warming as well as its location. These experiments have also revealed tradeoffs in experimental design between patch size, perturbation strength, and the length of control and patch simulations. The protocol chosen on the basis of these experiments balances scientific utility with the simulation time and setup required by the Green's function approach. Running these simulations will further our understanding of many aspects of atmospheric response, from the pattern effect and radiative feedbacks to changes in circulation, cloudiness, and precipitation.},

The impacts of MCB on regional climate are typically estimated using computationally expensive Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, preventing a thorough assessment of the large possibility space of potential MCB interventions. Here, we describe an AI model, named AiBEDO, that can be used to rapidly projects climate responses to forcings via a novel application of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT). AiBEDO is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model that uses maps monthly-mean radiation anomalies to surface climate anomalies at a range of time lags. By leveraging a large existing dataset of ESM simulations containing internal climate noise, we use AiBEDO to construct an FDT operator that successfully projects climate responses to MCB forcing, when evaluated against ESM simulations. We propose that AiBEDO-FDT can be used to optimize MCB forcing patterns to reduce tipping point risks while minimizing negative side effects in other parts of the climate.},

Both the pattern and magnitude of the MCB cooling depend strongly on location of the MCB intervention. We find the MCB cooling effect reduces most tipping element impacts; though differences in MCB versus GHG climate response patterns mean MCB is an imperfect remedy.

Historical spatial variations in surface temperature anomalies are derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys, and other sensors. Uncertainties arise from measurement uncertainty, changes in spatial coverage of the station record, and systematic biases due to technology shifts and land cover changes. Previously published uncertainty estimates for GISTEMP included only the effect of incomplete station coverage. Here, we update this term using currently available spatial distributions of source data, state-of-the-art reanalyses, and incorporate independently derived estimates for ocean data processing, station homogenization, and other structural biases. The resulting 95\% uncertainties are near 0.05 °C in the global annual mean for the last 50 years and increase going back further in time reaching 0.15 °C in 1880. In addition, we quantify the benefits and inherent uncertainty due to the GISTEMP interpolation and averaging method. We use the total uncertainties to estimate the probability for each record year in the GISTEMP to actually be the true record year (to that date) and conclude with 87\% likelihood that 2016 was indeed the hottest year of the instrumental period (so far).},

	abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field ({\textbackslash}aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},

	abstract = {Abstract The sensitivity of the climate to CO2 forcing depends on spatially varying radiative feedbacks that act both locally and nonlocally. We assess whether a method employing multiple regression can be used to estimate local and nonlocal radiative feedbacks from internal variability. We test this method on millennial-length simulations performed with six coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Given the spatial pattern of warming, the method does quite well at recreating the top-of-atmosphere flux response for most regions of Earth, except over the Southern Ocean where it consistently overestimates the change, leading to an overestimate of the sensitivity. For five of the six models, the method finds that local feedbacks are positive due to cloud processes, balanced by negative nonlocal shortwave cloud feedbacks associated with regions of tropical convection. For four of these models, the magnitudes of both are comparable to the Planck feedback, so that changes in the ratio between them could lead to large changes in climate sensitivity. The positive local feedback explains why observational studies that estimate spatial feedbacks using only local regressions predict an unstable climate. The method implies that sensitivity in these AOGCMs increases over time due to a reduction in the share of warming occurring in tropical convecting regions and the resulting weakening of associated shortwave cloud and longwave clear-sky feedbacks. Our results provide a step toward an observational estimate of time-varying climate sensitivity by demonstrating that many aspects of spatial feedbacks appear to be the same between internal variability and the forced response.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of global warming is controlled by climate feedbacks associated with various aspects of the climate system, such as clouds. The global climate feedback is the net effect of these feedbacks, and its temporal evolution is thought to depend on the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature pattern. However, current coupled climate models fail to simulate the pattern observed in the Pacific between 1979 and 2013 and its associated anomalously negative feedback. Here we demonstrate a mechanism whereby the Southern Ocean controls the global climate feedback. Using climate model experiments in which Southern Ocean sea surface temperatures are restored to observations, we show that accounting for recent Southern Ocean cooling—which is absent in coupled climate models—halves the bias in the global climate feedback by removing the cloud component bias. This global impact is mediated by a teleconnection to the Southeast Pacific, where remote sea surface temperature anomalies cause a strong stratocumulus cloud feedback. We propose that this Southern Ocean-driven pattern effect is underestimated in most climate models, owing to an overly weak stratocumulus cloud feedback. Addressing this bias may shift climate sensitivities to higher values than currently simulated as the Southern Ocean undergoes accelerated warming in future projections.},

Since June 2015, EPIC has been providing observations of the sunlit side of the Earth with its 10 spectral channels ranging from the UV to the near-infrared. A suite of algorithms has been developed to generate the standard EPIC Level 2 cloud products that include cloud mask, cloud effective pressure/height, and cloud optical thickness. The EPIC cloud mask adopts the threshold method and utilizes multichannel observations and ratios as tests. Cloud effective pressure/height is derived with observations from the O2 A-band (780 and 764\&thinsp;nm) and B-band (680 and 688\&thinsp;nm) pairs. The EPIC cloud optical thickness retrieval adopts a single-channel approach in which the 780 and 680\&thinsp;nm channels are used for retrievals over ocean and over land, respectively. Comparison with co-located cloud retrievals from geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites shows that the EPIC cloud product algorithms are performing well and are consistent with theoretical expectations. These products are publicly available at the Atmospheric Science Data Center at the NASA Langley Research Center for climate studies and for generating other geophysical products that require cloud properties as input.},

	abstract = {Abstract Global radiative feedbacks have been found to vary in global climate model (GCM) simulations. Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) driven with historical patterns of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice concentrations produce radiative feedbacks that trend toward more negative values, implying low climate sensitivity, over recent decades. Freely evolving coupled GCMs driven by increasing CO2 produce radiative feedbacks that trend toward more positive values, implying increasing climate sensitivity, in the future. While this time variation in feedbacks has been linked to evolving SST patterns, the role of particular regions has not been quantified. Here, a Green’s function is derived from a suite of simulations within an AGCM (NCAR’s CAM4), allowing an attribution of global feedback changes to surface warming in each region. The results highlight the radiative response to surface warming in ascent regions of the western tropical Pacific as the dominant control on global radiative feedback changes. Historical warming from the 1950s to 2000s preferentially occurred in the western Pacific, yielding a strong global outgoing radiative response at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and thus a strongly negative global feedback. Long-term warming in coupled GCMs occurs preferentially in tropical descent regions and in high latitudes, where surface warming yields small global TOA radiation change but large global surface air temperature change, and thus a less-negative global feedback. These results illuminate the importance of determining mechanisms of warm pool warming for understanding how feedbacks have varied historically and will evolve in the future.},

	abstract = {Abstract Global radiative feedbacks exhibit large dependence on the spatial structure of sea surface temperature (SST) changes, which is referred to as the “pattern effect.” A Green’s function (GF) approach has been demonstrated to be useful in identifying and understanding contributions of regional SST changes to global radiative feedbacks. Here, we explore the ability of the GF approach in quantifying the pattern effect in an atmospheric model (AM4) and a coupled model (CM4) recently developed at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), including the impact of SST changes on global-mean and local responses of key variables important to climate. Given historical SST patterns, the GF derived from idealized experiments with SST warming patches can largely reproduce AM4 simulated global-mean and regional responses. When AM4 is forced by SST patterns retrieved from the CM4 abrupt quadrupling of carbon dioxide experiment, the same GF captures interannual variations of AM4 simulated global-mean responses but falls short of reproducing the magnitude of the responses. A decomposition of such SST patterns into global-mean values plus remaining anomalies helps reduce biases. Additional idealized experiments are conducted to examine the sensitivity of the GF to the amplitude and sign of SST perturbations and to the integration time and the confidence level of the significance test. Impacts of these factors on the performance of the GF are discussed.},

In contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local interactions.

We demonstrate how combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the expressivity of transformers enables them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images. We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently model their composition within high-resolution images. Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information, such as segmentations, can control the generated image. In particular, we present the first results on semantically-guided synthesis of megapixel images with transformers and obtain the state of the art among autoregressive models on class-conditional ImageNet.

	abstract = {Diffusion models have significantly advanced the fields of image, audio, and video generation, but they depend on an iterative sampling process that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, we propose consistency models, a new family of models that generate high quality samples by directly mapping noise to data. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation. When trained in isolation, consistency models become a new family of generative models that can outperform existing one-step, non-adversarial generative models on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN 256x256.},

	title = {Evaluation of the 7-km {GEOS}-5 {Nature} {Run}},
	url = {https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150011486},
	abstract = {This report documents an evaluation by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) of a two-year 7-km-resolution non-hydrostatic global mesoscale simulation produced with the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) atmospheric general circulation model. The simulation was produced as a Nature Run for conducting observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). Generation of the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) was motivated in part by the desire of the OSSE community for an improved high-resolution sequel to an existing Nature Run produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which has served the community for several years. The intended use of the G5NR in this context is for generating simulated observations to test proposed observing system designs regarding new instruments and their deployments. Because NASA's interest in OSSEs extends beyond traditional weather forecasting applications, the G5NR includes, in addition to standard meteorological components, a suite of aerosol types and several trace gas concentrations, with emissions downscaled to 10 km using ancillary information such as power plant location, population density and night-light information. The evaluation exercise described here involved more than twenty-five GMAO scientists investigating various aspects of the G5NR performance, including time mean temperature and wind fields, energy spectra, precipitation and the hydrological cycle, the representation of waves, tropical cyclones and midlatitude storms, land and ocean surface characteristics, the representation and forcing effects of clouds and radiation, dynamics of the stratosphere and mesosphere, and the representation of aerosols and trace gases. Comparisons are made with observational data sets when possible, as well as with reanalyses and other long model simulations. The evaluation is broad in scope, as it is meant to assess the overall realism of basic aspects of the G5NR deemed relevant to the conduct of OSSEs. However, because of the relatively short record and other practical considerations, these comparisons cannot provide a definitive, statistically sound assessment of all model deficiencies, or guarantee the G5NR's suitability for all OSSE applications. Differences between the observed and simulated behavior also must be judged in the context of basic internal atmospheric variability which can introduce variations that are not necessarily controlled by the prescribed sea surface temperatures used in generating the G5NR. The results show that the G5NR performs well as measured by the majority of metrics applied in this evaluation. Particular benefits derived from the 7-km resolution of G5NR include realistic representations of extreme weather events in both the tropics and extratropics including tropical cyclones, Nor'easters and mesoscale convective complexes; improved representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over land; well-resolved surface-atmosphere interactions such as katabatic wind flows over Antarctica and Greenland; and resolution of orographically generated gravity waves that propagate into the upper atmosphere and influence the large scale circulation. Obvious deficiencies in the G5NR include a "splitting" of the inter-tropical convergence zone, which leads to a weaker-than-observed Hadley circulation and related deficiencies in the depiction of stationary wave patterns. Also, while the G5NR captures global cloud features and radiative effects well in general, close comparison with observations reveals higher-than-observed cloud brightness, likely due to an overabundance of cloud condensate; less distinct cloud minima in subtropical subsidence zones, consistent with a weak Hadley circualtion; and too few near-coastal marine stratocumulus clouds.},

However, most works focus on solving simple linear inverse problems in noiseless settings, which significantly under-represents the complexity of real-world problems. In this work, we extend diffusion solvers to efficiently handle general noisy (non)linear inverse problems via approximation of the posterior sampling. Interestingly, the resulting posterior sampling scheme is a blended version of diffusion sampling with the manifold constrained gradient without a strict measurement consistency projection step, yielding a more desirable generative path in noisy settings compared to the previous studies. Our method demonstrates that diffusion models can incorporate various measurement noise statistics such as Gaussian and Poisson, and also efficiently handle noisy nonlinear inverse problems such as Fourier phase retrieval and non-uniform deblurring.

	abstract = {We investigate the task of learning blind image denoising networks from an unpaired set of clean and noisy images. Such problem setting generally is practical and valuable considering that it is feasible to collect unpaired noisy and clean images in most real-world applications. And we further assume that the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order to facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network, this paper presents a two-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. For self-supervised learning, we suggest a dilated blind-spot network (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the spatial independence of noise, we adopt a network by stacking \$\$1{\textbackslash}times 1\$\$convolution layers to estimate the noise level map for each image. Both the D-BSN and image-specific noise model (\$\${\textbackslash}text \{CNN\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text \{est\}\}\$\$) can be jointly trained via maximizing the constrained log-likelihood. Given the output of D-BSN and estimated noise level map, improved denoising performance can be further obtained based on the Bayes’ rule. As for knowledge distillation, we first apply the learned noise models to clean images to synthesize a paired set of training images, and use the real noisy images and the corresponding denoising results in the first stage to form another paired set. Then, the ultimate denoising model can be distilled by training an existing denoising network using these two paired sets. Experiments show that our unpaired learning method performs favorably on both synthetic noisy images and real-world noisy photographs in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

	abstract = {In the last few years, image denoising has benefited a lot from the fast development of neural networks. However, the requirement of large amounts of noisy-clean image pairs for supervision limits the wide use of these models. Although there have been a few attempts in training an image denoising model with only single noisy images, existing self-supervised denoising approaches suffer from inefficient network training, loss of useful information, or dependence on noise modeling. In this paper, we present a very simple yet effective method named Neighbor2Neighbor to train an effective image denoising model with only noisy images. Firstly, a random neighbor sub-sampler is proposed for the generation of training image pairs. In detail, input and target used to train a network are images sub-sampled from the same noisy image, satisfying the requirement that paired pixels of paired images are neighbors and have very similar appearance with each other. Secondly, a denoising network is trained on sub-sampled training pairs generated in the first stage, with a proposed regularizer as additional loss for better performance. The proposed Neighbor2Neighbor framework is able to enjoy the progress of state-of-the-art supervised denoising networks in network architecture design. Moreover, it avoids heavy dependence on the assumption of the noise distribution. We explain our approach from a theoretical perspective and further validate it through extensive experiments, including synthetic experiments with different noise distributions in sRGB space and real-world experiments on a denoising benchmark dataset in raw-RGB space.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing medical images from partial measurements is an important inverse problem in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes.},

The commonly-adopted formulation of the latent code of diffusion models is a sequence of gradually denoised samples, as opposed to the simpler (e.g., Gaussian) latent space of GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows. This paper provides an alternative, Gaussian formulation of the latent space of various diffusion models, as well as an invertible DPM-Encoder that maps images into the latent space. While our formulation is purely based on the definition of diffusion models, we demonstrate several intriguing consequences. (1) Empirically, we observe that a common latent space emerges from two diffusion models trained independently on related domains. In light of this finding, we propose CycleDiffusion, which uses DPM-Encoder for unpaired image-to-image translation. Furthermore, applying CycleDiffusion to text-to-image diffusion models, we show that large-scale text-to-image diffusion models can be used as zero-shot image-to-image editors. (2) One can guide pre-trained diffusion models and GANs by controlling the latent codes in a unified, plug-and-play formulation based on energy-based models. Using the CLIP model and a face recognition model as guidance, we demonstrate that diffusion models have better coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals than GANs.

	abstract = {Denoising diffusion models are a powerful type of generative models used to capture complex distributions of real-world signals. However, their applicability is limited to scenarios where training samples are readily available, which is not always the case in real-world applications. For example, in inverse graphics, the goal is to generate samples from a distribution of 3D scenes that align with a given image, but ground-truth 3D scenes are unavailable and only 2D images are accessible. To address this limitation, we propose a novel class of denoising diffusion probabilistic models that learn to sample from distributions of signals that are never directly observed. Instead, these signals are measured indirectly through a known differentiable forward model, which produces partial observations of the unknown signal. Our approach involves integrating the forward model directly into the denoising process. This integration effectively connects the generative modeling of observations with the generative modeling of the underlying signals, allowing for end-to-end training of a conditional generative model over signals. During inference, our approach enables sampling from the distribution of underlying signals that are consistent with a given partial observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three challenging computer vision tasks. For instance, in the context of inverse graphics, our model enables direct sampling from the distribution of 3D scenes that align with a single 2D input image.},

We show that for a specific weighting scheme, the objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood, thus enabling approximate maximum likelihood training of score-based diffusion models. We empirically observe that maximum likelihood training consistently improves the likelihood of score-based diffusion models across multiple datasets, stochastic processes, and model architectures.

Global emissions peaked in the early 1970s and decreased until 2000, with an increase in recent years due to increased emissions in China, international shipping, and developing countries in general. An uncertainty analysis was conducted including both random and systemic uncertainties. The overall global uncertainty in sulfur dioxide emissions is relatively small, but regional uncertainties ranged up to 30\%. The largest contributors to uncertainty at present are emissions from China and international shipping. Emissions were distributed on a 0.5° grid by sector for use in coordinated climate model experiments.},

	abstract = {Abstract Based on research showing that in the case of a strong aerosol forcing, this forcing establishes itself early in the historical record, a simple model is constructed to explore the implications of a strongly negative aerosol forcing on the early (pre-1950) part of the instrumental record. This model, which contains terms representing both aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, well represents the known time history of aerosol radiative forcing as well as the effect of the natural state on the strength of aerosol forcing. Model parameters, randomly drawn to represent uncertainty in understanding, demonstrate that a forcing more negative than −1.0 W m−2 is implausible, as it implies that none of the approximately 0.3-K temperature rise between 1850 and 1950 can be attributed to Northern Hemisphere forcing. The individual terms of the model are interpreted in light of comprehensive modeling, constraints from observations, and physical understanding to provide further support for the less negative (−1.0 W m−2) lower bound. These findings suggest that aerosol radiative forcing is less negative and more certain than is commonly believed.},

We randomly mask out spacetime patches in videos and learn an autoencoder to reconstruct them in pixels. Interestingly, we show that our MAE method can learn strong representations with almost no inductive bias on spacetime (only except for patch and positional embeddings), and spacetime-agnostic random masking performs the best. We observe that the optimal masking ratio is as high as 90\% (vs. 75\% on images), supporting the hypothesis that this ratio is related to information redundancy of the data. A high masking ratio leads to a large speedup, e.g., {\textgreater} 4x in wall-clock time or even more. We report competitive results on several challenging video datasets using vanilla Vision Transformers. We observe that MAE can outperform supervised pre-training by large margins. We further report encouraging results of training on real-world, uncurated Instagram data. Our study suggests that the general framework of masked autoencoding (BERT, MAE, etc.) can be a unified methodology for representation learning with minimal domain knowledge.},

However, compared to using appearance, it has some blind spots, such as the fact that objects become invisible if they do not move. In this work, we propose an approach that combines the strengths of motion-based and appearance-based segmentation. We propose to supervise an image segmentation network with the pretext task of predicting regions that are likely to contain simple motion patterns, and thus likely to correspond to objects. As the model only uses a single image as input, we can apply it in two settings: unsupervised video segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results for videos, and demonstrate the viability of our approach on still images containing novel objects. Additionally we experiment with different motion models and optical flow backbones and find the method to be robust to these change.

This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.},

This fundamental metric has not been directly observed globally and previous estimates have come from models. In part, this is because current space-based instruments cannot distinguish the instantaneous radiative forcing from the climate’s radiative response. We apply radiative kernels to satellite observations to disentangle these components and find all-sky instantaneous radiative forcing has increased 0.53 ± 0.11 W/m2 from 2003 to 2018, accounting for positive trends in the total planetary radiative imbalance. This increase has been due to a combination of rising concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases and recent reductions in aerosol emissions. These results highlight distinct fingerprints of anthropogenic activity in Earth’s changing energy budget, which we find observations can detect within 4 years.},

	abstract = {The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project has now produced over two decades of observed data on the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) and has revealed substantive trends in both the reflected shortwave and outgoing longwave top-of-atmosphere radiation components. Available climate model simulations suggest that these trends are incompatible with purely internal variability, but that the full magnitude and breakdown of the trends are outside of the model ranges. Unfortunately, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6) (CMIP6) protocol only uses observed forcings to 2014 (and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) projections thereafter), and furthermore, many of the ‘observed’ drivers have been updated substantially since the CMIP6 inputs were defined. Most notably, the sea surface temperature (SST) estimates have been revised and now show up to 50\% greater trends since 1979, particularly in the southern hemisphere. Additionally, estimates of short-lived aerosol and gas-phase emissions have been substantially updated. These revisions will likely have material impacts on the model-simulated EEI. We therefore propose a new, relatively low-cost, model intercomparison, CERESMIP, that would target the CERES period (2000-present), with updated forcings to at least the end of 2021. The focus will be on atmosphere-only simulations, using updated SST, forcings and emissions from 1990-2021. The key metrics of interest will be the EEI and atmospheric feedbacks, and so the analysis will benefit from output from satellite cloud observation simulators. The Tier 1 request would consist only of an ensemble of AMIP-style simulations, while the Tier 2 request would encompass uncertainties in the applied forcing, atmospheric composition, single and all-but-one forcing responses. We present some preliminary results and invite participation from a wide group of models.},

	abstract = {Abstract Satellite observations show a near-zero trend in the top-of-atmosphere global-mean net cloud radiative effect (CRE), suggesting that clouds did not further cool nor heat the planet over the last two decades. The causes of this observed trend are unknown and can range from effective radiative forcing (ERF) to cloud feedbacks, cloud masking, and internal variability. We find that the near-zero NetCRE trend is a result of a significant negative trend in the longwave (LW) CRE and a significant positive trend in the shortwave (SW) CRE, cooling and heating the climate system, respectively. We find that it is exceptionally unlikely ({\textless}1\% probability) that internal variability can explain the observed LW and SW CRE trends. Instead, the majority of the observed LWCRE trend arises from cloud masking wherein increases in greenhouse gases reduce OLR in all-sky conditions less than in clear-sky conditions. In SWCRE, rapid cloud adjustments to greenhouse gases, aerosols, and natural forcing agents (ERF) explain a majority of the observed trend. Over the northeast Pacific, we show that ERF, hitherto an ignored factor, contributes as much as cloud feedbacks to the observed SWCRE trend. Large contributions from ERF and cloud masking to the global-mean LW and SW CRE trends are supplemented by negative LW and positive SW cloud feedback trends, which are detectable at 80\%–95\% confidence depending on the observational uncertainty assumed. The large global-mean LW and SW cloud feedbacks cancel, leaving a small net cloud feedback that is unconstrained in sign, implying that clouds could amplify or dampen global warming.},

Here we use climate model simulations from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project, as well as regularized optimal fingerprinting, to show that anthropogenic forcings caused 0.9 to 1.3 °C of warming in global mean near-surface air temperature in 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900, compared with an observed warming of 1.1 °C.

Strong relationships are found between the monthly and interannual variability of tropical clouds, and the tropical net cloud feedback. These relationships are combined with observations to substantially narrow the uncertainty in the tropical cloud feedback and demonstrate that the tropical cloud feedback is likely {\textgreater}0Wm−2K−1.

Using climate model simulations, we show that it is exceptionally unlikely ({\textless}1\% probability) that this trend can be explained by internal variability. Instead, TEEI is achieved only upon accounting for the increase in anthropogenic radiative forcing and the associated climate response. TEEI is driven by a large decrease in reflected solar radiation and a small increase in emitted infrared radiation. This is because recent changes in forcing and feedbacks are additive in the solar spectrum, while being nearly offset by each other in the infrared.

	abstract = {Human activities affect the Earth’s climate through modifying the composition of the atmosphere, which then creates radiative forcing that drives climate change. The warming effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases has been partially balanced by the cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols. In 2020, fuel regulations abruptly reduced the emission of sulfur dioxide from international shipping by about 80\% and created an inadvertent geoengineering termination shock with global impact. Here we estimate the regulation leads to a radiative forcing of \$\$+0.2{\textbackslash}pm 0.11\$\$Wm−2 averaged over the global ocean. The amount of radiative forcing could lead to a doubling (or more) of the warming rate in the 2020 s compared with the rate since 1980 with strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The warming effect is consistent with the recent observed strong warming in 2023 and expected to make the 2020 s anomalously warm. The forcing is equivalent in magnitude to 80\% of the measured increase in planetary heat uptake since 2020. The radiative forcing also has strong hemispheric contrast, which has important implications for precipitation pattern changes. Our result suggests marine cloud brightening may be a viable geoengineering method in temporarily cooling the climate that has its unique challenges due to inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity.},

The forcing partially offsets the greenhouse warming and positively correlates with the climate sensitivity. However, it remains highly uncertain. Here, we show direct observational evidence for strong forcing from Cf adjustment to increased aerosols and weak forcing from cloud liquid water path adjustment. We estimate that the Cf adjustment drives between 52\% and 300\% of additional forcing to the Twomey effect over the ocean and a total AIF of −1.1 ± 0.8 W m−2. The Cf adjustment follows a power law as a function of background cloud droplet number concentration, Nd . It thus depends on time and location and is stronger when Nd  is low. Cf only increases substantially when background clouds start to drizzle, suggesting a role for aerosol-precipitation interactions. Our findings highlight the Cf adjustment as the key process for reducing the uncertainty of AIF and thus future climate projections.},

	abstract = {Warm boundary layer clouds in the eastern North Atlantic region exhibit significant diurnal variations in cloud properties. However, the diurnal cycle of the aerosol indirect effect (AIE) for these clouds remains poorly understood. This study takes advantage of recent advancements in the spatial resolution of geostationary satellites to explore the daytime variation in the AIE by estimating the cloud susceptibilities to changes in cloud droplet number concentration ( N d ). Cloud retrievals for the month of July over 4 years (2018-2021) from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on Meteosat-11 over this region are analyzed. Our results reveal a significant "U-shaped" daytime cycle in susceptibilities of the cloud liquid water path (LWP), cloud albedo, and cloud fraction. Clouds are found to be more susceptible to N d perturbations at noon and less susceptible in the morning and evening. The magnitude and sign of cloud susceptibilities depend heavily on the cloud state defined by cloud LWP and precipitation conditions. Non-precipitating thin clouds account for 44 \% of all warm boundary layer clouds in July, and they contribute the most to the observed daytime variation. Non-precipitating thick clouds are the least frequent cloud state (10 \%), and they exhibit more negative LWP and albedo susceptibilities compared to thin clouds. Precipitating clouds are the dominant cloud state (46 \%), but their cloud susceptibilities show minimal variation throughout the day.We find evidence that the daytime variation in LWP and albedo susceptibilities for non-precipitating clouds is influenced by a combination of the diurnal transition between non-precipitating thick and thin clouds and the "lagged" cloud responses to N d perturbations. The daytime variation in cloud fraction susceptibility for non-precipitating thick clouds can be attributed to the daytime variation in cloud morphology (e.g., overcast or broken). The dissipation and development of clouds do not adequately explain the observed variation in cloud susceptibilities. Additionally, daytime variation in cloud susceptibility is primarily driven by variation in the intensity of cloud response rather than the frequency of occurrence of cloud states. Our results imply that polar-orbiting satellites with an overpass time at 13:30 LT underestimate daytime mean values of cloud susceptibility, as they observe susceptibility daily minima in the study region.},

The median lifetime for polluted cloud tracks in Eastern Europe studied using Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager data is 18 hr but shows a strongly skewed distribution toward longer lifetimes. This suggests that ship-track-like cloud perturbations help infer causal relationships between aerosols and clouds. Strong anthropogenic cloud perturbations are usually visible until favorable liquid-water low-level clouds exist. Only in 12\% of cases do liquid-phase stratiform clouds persist, but tracks disappear. Longer-lived tracks occur in anticyclonic conditions, and in case of statically very stable lower troposphere and low relative humidity above clouds.},

	abstract = {Ship tracks in subtropical marine low clouds are simulated and investigated using large-eddy simulations. Five variants of a shallow subtropical stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) are chosen to span a range of background aerosol concentrations and variations in free-tropospheric moisture. Idealized time-invariant meteorological forcings and approximately steady-state aerosol concentrations constitute the background conditions. We investigate processes controlling cloud microphysical, macrophysical, and radiative responses to aerosol injections. For the analysis, we use novel methods to decompose the liquid water path (LWP) adjustment into changes in cloud and boundary-layer properties and to decompose the cloud radiative effect (CRE) into contributions from cloud macro- and microphysics. The key results are that (a) the cloud-top entrainment rate increases in all cases, with stronger increases for thicker than thinner clouds; (b) the drying and warming induced by increased entrainment is offset to differing degrees by corresponding responses in surface fluxes, precipitation, and radiation; (c) MBL turbulence responds to changes caused by the aerosol perturbation, and this significantly affects cloud macrophysics; (d) across 2 d of simulation, clouds were brightened in all cases. In a pristine MBL, significant drizzle suppression by aerosol injections results not only in greater water retention but also in turbulence intensification, leading to a significant increase in cloud amount. In this case, Twomey brightening is strongly augmented by an increase in cloud thickness and cover. In addition, a reduction in the loss of aerosol through coalescence scavenging more than offsets the entrainment dilution. This interplay precludes estimation of the lifetime of the aerosol perturbation. The combined responses of cloud macro- and microphysics lead to 10-100 times more effective cloud brightening in these cases relative to those in the non-precipitating MBL cases. In moderate and polluted MBLs, entrainment enhancement makes the boundary layer drier, warmer, and more stratified, leading to a decrease in cloud thickness. This LWP response offsets the greatest fraction of the Twomey brightening in a moderately moist free troposphere. This finding differs from previous studies that found larger offsets in a drier free troposphere, and it results from a greater entrainment enhancement of initially thicker clouds, so the offsetting effects are weaker. The injected aerosol lifetime in cases with polluted MBLs is estimated to be 2-3 d, which is much longer than estimates of typical ship track lifetimes from satellite images.},

Previous analysis of polluted cloud tracks shows that cloud water response to aerosols is bidirectional. Here, we show that cloud water gradually increases in the afternoon for polluted clouds in some cases. Aerosol-induced cloud thickening is much more likely in the case of thin unpolluted clouds. However, on average, there is less cloud water in the polluted clouds compared to the nearby unpolluted clouds. The temporal evolution of cloud thinning is not observed, and polluted clouds are thinner than the nearby unpolluted clouds since the early morning. The physical mechanisms leading to the observed changes and the influence of retrieval bias on the detected changes need further clarification.

	abstract = {A key uncertainty in Aerosol-cloud interactions is the cloud liquid water path (LWP) response to increased aerosols (lambda). LWP can either increase due to precipitation suppression or decrease due to entrainment-drying. Previous research suggests that precipitation suppression dominates in thick clouds, while entrainment-drying prevails in thin clouds. The time scales of the two competing effects are vastly different, requiring temporally resolved observations. We analyze 3-day Lagrangian trajectories of stratocumulus clouds over the southeast Pacific using 2019-2021 geostationary data. We find that clouds with a LWP exceeding 200 g m-2 exhibit a positive response, while clouds with lower LWP show a negative response. We observe a significant diurnal cycle in lambda, indicating a more strongly negative daytime adjustment driven by entrainment-drying. In contrast, at night, precipitation suppression can occasionally fully counteract the entrainment-drying mechanism. Overall, lambda appears weaker than previously suggested in studies that do not account for the diurnal cycle. We examine how aerosols affect cloud properties, specifically cloud liquid water path (LWP). We find that the impact of aerosols on LWP varies with cloud thickness and time of day. Thicker clouds are more influenced by entrainment-drying during the day and precipitation suppression at night, while thinner clouds that are less likely to precipitate and tend to produce less intense precipitation are much more susceptible to entrainment-drying no matter time of day. Overall, this nuanced understanding of how LWP responds to aerosols may help constrain the influence of aerosol-cloud-interactions on climate. The overall adjustment in cloud water path to aerosols is generally negative There is a strong diurnal cycle in the adjustment of cloud liquid water path to aerosols that may relate to precipitation The overall adjustment in cloud water path to aerosols appears to be weaker than previous studies suggest},

Analyzed 925-hPa winds were used to predict the afternoon positions of ship tracks found in the morning imagery. Droplet effective radii, visible optical depths, and liquid water amounts were analyzed for morning and afternoon clouds that, based on the low-level winds, were taken to be the same clouds. As found in a previous study by Segrin et al., both morning and afternoon polluted clouds had smaller droplet radii, larger optical depths, and smaller liquid water amounts than the nearby unpolluted clouds. In contrast to the Segrin et al. study, however, the droplet effective radii decreased significantly from morning to afternoon in both the polluted and unpolluted clouds, with the rate of decrease being twice as large for the unpolluted clouds. The larger decrease in the unpolluted clouds is thought to be caused by drizzle, which is probably absent in the polluted clouds. The observations suggest that, with their slower rate of liquid loss, polluted clouds could have longer lifetimes than their unpolluted counterparts. Of interest is that clouds with similar droplet radii but smaller optical depths, and thus smaller droplet number concentrations and liquid water amounts, exhibited higher sensitivities to the effects of elevated particle concentrations and a greater likelihood of appearing in both the morning and afternoon satellite overpasses.},

Aerosol plumes generated by ships sometimes influence cloud microphysics and, to a largely undetermined extent, precipitation. To assess this response, the locations of over one thousand ship tracks coinciding with the radar were meticulously logged by hand from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Although precipitation detectable by the radar was infrequent, drizzle rates were often suppressed (72\% of cases) and lighter in the ship tracks compared to the clouds adjacent to them. Ship plumes primarily decreased average rain rates through reducing the spatial coverage of precipitation. However, larger liquid water paths in ship tracks seldom coincided with the reduced cloud water sink from the suppression of precipitation (in less than 20\% of cases). The sign and strength of the precipitation response was primarily tied to the mesoscale convective structure of the clouds. When closed cellular clouds were identified, significant decreases in the relative average liquid water path, rain rate (an average relative decrease of 68\%), and rain cover fraction were observed in ship tracks compared to the surrounding clouds. The opposite occurred in the open cell regime where it was more common to find enhanced precipitation in the perturbed clouds. Ship plumes ingested into this regime resulted in significantly deeper and brighter clouds with higher liquid water amounts and rain rates (an average relative increase of 89\%).},

Marine cloud brightening is one proposed method to tackle warming through injecting aerosols into marine clouds to enhance their reflectivity and thereby planetary albedo. However, because it is unclear how aerosols influence clouds, especially cloud cover, both climate projections and the effectiveness of marine cloud brightening remain uncertain. Here we use satellite observations of volcanic eruptions in Hawaii to quantify the aerosol fingerprint on tropical marine clouds. We observe a large enhancement in reflected sunlight, mainly due to an aerosol-induced increase in cloud cover. This observed strong negative aerosol forcing suggests that the current level of global warming is driven by a weaker net radiative forcing than previously thought, arising from the competing effects of greenhouse gases and aerosols. This implies a greater sensitivity of Earth’s climate to radiative forcing and therefore a larger warming response to both rising greenhouse gas concentrations and reductions in atmospheric aerosols due to air quality measures. However, our findings also indicate that mitigation of global warming via marine cloud brightening is plausible and is most effective in humid and stable conditions in the tropics where solar radiation is strong.},

	abstract = {Recent large-eddy simulation (LES) studies of the impact of aerosol on the dynamics of nocturnal marine stratocumulus revealed that, depending on the large-scale forcings, an aerosol-induced increase of the droplet concentration can lead to either an increase or a decrease of the liquid water path, hence contrasting with the cloud thickening that is expected from a reduction of the precipitation efficiency. In this study, the aerosol impacts on cloud microphysics are examined in the context of the boundary-layer diurnal cycle using 36-h LES simulations of pristine and polluted clouds. These simulations corroborate previous findings that during nighttime aerosol-induced liquid water path changes are sensitive to the large-scale forcings via enhancement of cloud-top entrainment such that, ultimately, the liquid water path may be reduced when the free-tropospheric-entrained air is drier. During the day, however, enhanced entrainment, inhibition of drizzle evaporation below cloud base, and reduced sensible heat flux from the surface lead to a more pronounced decoupling of the boundary layer, which significantly amplifies the liquid water path reduction of the polluted clouds. At night the sign of the liquid water path difference between pristine and polluted clouds depends upon large-scale forcings, while during the day the liquid water path of polluted clouds is always smaller than the one of the pristine clouds. Suggestions are made on how observational studies could be designed for validation of these simulations.},

	abstract = {We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6–3.9 K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3–4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5–95\% ranges are 2.3–4.7 K, bounded by 2.0–5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

Ships can release large numbers of aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei, which can create artificially brightened clouds known as ship tracks. These aerosol emissions offer a "natural'', or "opportunistic'', experiment to explore aerosol effects on clouds while disentangling meteorological influences. Utilising ship positions and reanalysis winds, we predict ship track locations, collocating them with satellite data to depict the temporal evolution of cloud properties after an aerosol perturbation. Repeating our analysis for a null experiment does not necessarily recover zero signal as expected, but instead reveals subtleties between different null experiment methodologies. This study uncovers a systematic bias in prior ship track research, due to the assumption that background gradients will, on average, be linear. We correct for this bias, which is linked to the correlation between wind fields and cloud properties, to reveal the true ship track response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We find that the liquid water path (LWP) response after an aerosol pertubation is weak on average, once this bias is corrected for. This has important implications for estimates of radiative forcings due to LWP adjustments, as previous responses in unstable cases were overestimated. A noticeable LWP response is only recovered in specific cases, such as marine stratocumulus clouds, where a positive LWP response is found in precipitating or clean clouds. This work highlights subtleties in the analysis of isolated opportunistic experiments, reconciling differences in the LWP response to aerosols reported in previous studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Ship tracks are long-lived, linear regions of enhanced reflectivity in low-lying marine clouds that appear in satellite imagery downwind of ships. Ship tracks were first observed as cloud lines in visible satellite imagery (type 1). A second (and more common) type of ship track (type 2), which is masked at visible wavelengths by natural variability in cloud reflectivity, is seen at near-infrared wavelengths in satellite imagery. A one-dimensional numerical model is used to simulate measurements of both types of ship tracks and to investigate interactions between aerosol and cloud microphysics, radiative transfer, and turbulent mixing in the cloud-topped marine boundary layer that lead to the formation and provide for the persistence of ship tracks. We find that cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) injections can account for many of the observed properties of ship tracks. Higher CCN concentrations produce increased droplet concentrations, which enhance cloud reflectivity by reducing droplet radius and increasing droplet cross-sectional area. The smaller droplets also reduce the drizzle rate, which can allow cloud water to increase under some conditions, thereby leading to higher cloud reflectivity. However, smaller droplets also evaporate more readily below cloud base. Increased evaporation reduces mixing between the cloud and the subcloud layers during daytime, which causes a decrease in cloud water. The distinction between the two types of ship tracks is suggested to be due to differences in ambient concentrations of CCN that cause variations in turbulent mixing in the boundary layer, through the effect of cloud droplet concentrations on cloud-top longwave radiative cooling. The model predicts lifetimes of {\textgreater} 1 day and {\textgreater} 2 days for the simulated type 1 and type 2 ship tracks, respectively. In the atmosphere, processes not treated in the model, such as horizontal dispersion and changes in large-scale atmospheric conditions, may limit ship track lifetimes.},

	abstract = {The detection of the early growth of drizzle particles in marine stratocumulus clouds is important for studying the transition from cloud water to rainwater. Radar reflectivity is commonly used to detect drizzle; however, its utility is limited to larger drizzle particles. Alternatively, radar Doppler spectrum skewness has proven to be a more sensitive quantity for the detection of drizzle embryos. Here, a machine learning (ML)-based technique that uses radar reflectivity and skewness for detecting small drizzle particles is presented. Aircraft in situ measurements are used to develop and validate the ML algorithm. The drizzle detection algorithm is applied to three Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) observational campaigns to investigate the drizzle occurrence in marine boundary layer clouds. It is found that drizzle is far more ubiquitous than previously thought; the traditional radar-reflectivity-based approach significantly underestimates the drizzle occurrence, especially in thin clouds with liquid water paths lower than 50 g m−2. Furthermore, the drizzle occurrence in marine boundary layer clouds differs among the three ARM campaigns, indicating that the drizzle formation, which is controlled by the microphysical process, is regime dependent. A complete understanding of the drizzle distribution climatology in marine stratocumulus clouds calls for more observational campaigns and continuing investigations.},

Such climate model results will guide future decisions regarding the feasibility and application of large-scale intentional marine cloud brightening (MCB). Prior modeling studies have shown that the rate at which ship plumes spread may be strongly dependent on meteorological conditions, such as precipitating versus non-precipitating boundary layers and shear. In this study, we apply a Lagrangian particle model (PM-ABL v1.0), governed by a Langevin stochastic differential equation, to create a simplified framework for predicting the rate of spreading from a ship-injected aerosol plume in sheared, precipitating, and non-precipitating boundary layers. The velocity and position of each stochastic particle is predicted with the acceleration of each particle being driven by the turbulent kinetic energy, dissipation rate, momentum variance, and mean wind. These inputs to the stochastic particle velocity equation are derived from high-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES) equipped with a prognostic aerosol–cloud microphysics scheme (UW-SAM) to simulate an aerosol injection from a ship into a cloud-topped marine boundary layer. The resulting spreading rate from the reduced-order stochastic model is then compared to the spreading rate in the LES. The stochastic particle velocity representation is shown to reasonably reproduce spreading rates in sheared, precipitating, and non-precipitating cases using domain-averaged turbulent statistics from the LES.},

Ship-track frequency is more than 10 times higher than a previous survey, and its interannual fluctuations reflect variations in cross-ocean trade, shipping activity, and fuel regulations. Fuel regulation can alter both detected frequency and shipping routes due to cost. The 2020 fuel regulation, together with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, reduced ship-track frequency to its lowest level in recent decades across the globe and may have ushered in an era of low frequency. The regulation reduces the aerosol indirect forcing from ship emissions by 46\% or between 0.02 and 0.27 W m−2 given its current estimates.},

The increase is the result of a 0.9 ± 0.3 Wm−2 increase absorbed solar radiation (ASR) that is partially offset by a 0.4 ± 0.25 Wm−2 increase in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). Despite marked differences in ASR and OLR trends during the hiatus (2000–2010), transition-to-El Niño (2010–2016) and post-El Niño (2016–2022) periods, trends in net top-of-atmosphere flux (NET) remain within 0.1 Wm−2 per decade of one another, implying a steady acceleration of climate warming. Northern and southern hemisphere trends in NET are consistent to 0.06 ± 0.31 Wm−2 per decade due to a compensation between weak ASR and OLR hemispheric trend differences of opposite sign. We find that large decreases in stratocumulus and middle clouds over the sub-tropics and decreases in low and middle clouds at mid-latitudes are the primary reasons for increasing ASR trends in the northern hemisphere (NH). These changes are especially large over the eastern and northern Pacific Ocean, and coincide with large increases in sea-surface temperature (SST). The decrease in cloud fraction and higher SSTs over the NH sub-tropics lead to a significant increase in OLR from cloud-free regions, which partially compensate for the NH ASR increase. Decreases in middle cloud reflection and a weaker reduction in low-cloud reflection account for the increase in ASR in the southern hemisphere, while OLR changes are weak. Changes in cloud cover in response to SST increases imply a feedback to climate change yet a contribution from radiative forcing or internal variability cannot be ruled out.},

	abstract = {To tackle the problem of severe air pollution, China has implemented active clean air policies in recent years. As a consequence, the emissions of major air pollutants have decreased and the air quality has substantially improved. Here, we quantified China's anthropogenic emission trends from 2010 to 2017 and identified the major driving forces of these trends by using a combination of bottom-up emission inventory and index decomposition analysis (IDA) approaches. The relative change rates of China's anthropogenic emissions during 2010–2017 are estimated as follows: −62\&thinsp;\% for SO2, −17\&thinsp;\% for NOx, +11\&thinsp;\% for nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), +1\&thinsp;\% for NH3, −27\&thinsp;\% for CO, −38\&thinsp;\% for PM10, −35\&thinsp;\% for PM2.5, −27\&thinsp;\% for BC, −35\&thinsp;\% for OC, and +16\&thinsp;\% for CO2. The IDA results suggest that emission control measures are the main drivers of this reduction, in which the pollution controls on power plants and industries are the most effective mitigation measures. The emission reduction rates markedly accelerated after the year 2013, confirming the effectiveness of China's Clean Air Action that was implemented since 2013. We estimated that during 2013–2017, China's anthropogenic emissions decreased by 59\&thinsp;\% for SO2, 21\&thinsp;\% for NOx, 23\&thinsp;\% for CO, 36\&thinsp;\% for PM10, 33\&thinsp;\% for PM2.5, 28\&thinsp;\% for BC, and 32\&thinsp;\% for OC. NMVOC emissions increased and NH3 emissions remained stable during 2010–2017, representing the absence of effective mitigation measures for NMVOCs and NH3 in current policies. The relative contributions of different sectors to emissions have significantly changed after several years' implementation of clean air policies, indicating that it is paramount to introduce new policies to enable further emission reductions in the future.},

Here we use satellite observations to show that the aerosol–Nd relation (in log–log space) is not linear as commonly assumed. Instead, the Nd sensitivity decreases at large aerosol concentrations due to the transition from aerosol-limited to updraft-limited regime, making the widely used linear method problematic. A sigmoidal transition is shown to adequately fit the data. When using this revised relationship, the additional warming that arises from air pollution mitigation is delayed by two to three decades in heavily polluted locations, compared to the linear relationship. This cloud-mediated climate penalty will manifest markedly starting around 2025 in China and 2050 in India after applying the strongest air quality policy, underlining the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.},

Observationally constraining cloud radiative feedback, a notably uncertain climate feedback mechanism3–5, is crucial for improving predictions of climate change5–7 but, so far, remains an elusive objective, and the feedback may be different over the ocean versus over land8–10. Here we show a local negative surface longwave cloud feedback over land at the southern Great Plains site, constrained by direct long-term observation of spectrally resolved downwelling longwave radiance11. This negative cloud feedback at the southern Great Plains site causes a −1.77 ± 1.15 W m−2 per decade change in downwelling longwave radiation and suggests that cloud changes may partially modulate the warming effect of increased greenhouse gas concentrations and atmospheric temperatures over land. Specifically, our results are derived from an optimal spectral fingerprinting method12–15 designed to separate surface longwave cloud feedback from other surface forcings and feedbacks, by making use of their unique spectral signatures13–18 in the long-term record of spectrally resolved radiances. Furthermore, we show that the results are not site specific: negative surface longwave cloud feedbacks, primarily induced by decreasing low cloud cover in warming climates, are commonly observed over land in reanalysis and satellite datasets. Our findings establish a pivotal observational benchmark of radiative forcing and feedback needed for validating climate model performance over land.},

	abstract = {The Earth climate system is out of energy balance, and heat has accumulated continuously over the past decades, warming the ocean, the land, the cryosphere, and the atmosphere. According to the Sixth Assessment Report by Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this planetary warming over multiple decades is human-driven and results in unprecedented and committed changes to the Earth system, with adverse impacts for ecosystems and human systems. The Earth heat inventory provides a measure of the Earth energy imbalance (EEI) and allows for quantifying how much heat has accumulated in the Earth system, as well as where the heat is stored. Here we show that the Earth system has continued to accumulate heat, with 381±61 ZJ accumulated from 1971 to 2020. This is equivalent to a heating rate (i.e., the EEI) of 0.48±0.1 W m−2. The majority, about 89 \%, of this heat is stored in the ocean, followed by about 6 \% on land, 1 \% in the atmosphere, and about 4 \% available for melting the cryosphere. Over the most recent period (2006–2020), the EEI amounts to 0.76±0.2 W m−2. The Earth energy imbalance is the most fundamental global climate indicator that the scientific community and the public can use as the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing anthropogenic climate change under control. Moreover, this indicator is highly complementary to other established ones like global mean surface temperature as it represents a robust measure of the rate of climate change and its future commitment. We call for an implementation of the Earth energy imbalance into the Paris Agreement's Global Stocktake based on best available science. The Earth heat inventory in this study, updated from von Schuckmann et al. (2020), is underpinned by worldwide multidisciplinary collaboration and demonstrates the critical importance of concerted international efforts for climate change monitoring and community-based recommendations and we also call for urgently needed actions for enabling continuity, archiving, rescuing, and calibrating efforts to assure improved and long-term monitoring capacity of the global climate observing system. The data for the Earth heat inventory are publicly available, and more details are provided in Table 4.},

	abstract = {Interactions between aerosols and liquid clouds are one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the historical radiative forcing of climate. One widely shared goal to reduce this uncertainty is to decompose radiative anomalies arising from aerosol–cloud interactions into components associated with changes in cloud-droplet number concentration (Twomey effect), liquid-water-path adjustments, and cloud-fraction adjustments. However, there has not been a quantitative foundation for simultaneously estimating these components with global satellite observations. Here we present a method for assessing shortwave radiative flux anomalies from the Twomey effect and cloud adjustments over ocean between 55∘ S and 55∘ N. We find that larger aerosol concentrations are associated with widespread cloud brightening from the Twomey effect, a positive radiative adjustment from decreasing liquid water path in subtropical stratocumulus regions, and a negative radiative adjustment from increasing cloud fraction in the subtropics and midlatitudes. The Twomey effect and total cloud adjustment have contributed −0.77 ± 0.25 and −1.02 ± 0.43 W m−2, respectively, to the effective radiative forcing since 1850 over the domain (95 \% confidence). Our findings reduce uncertainty in these components of aerosol forcing and suggest that cloud adjustments make a larger contribution to the forcing than is commonly believed.},

	abstract = {The phrasing of the first of three questions motivating CMIP6 – “How does the Earth system respond to forcing?” – suggests that forcing is always well-known, yet the radiative forcing to which this question refers has historically been uncertain in coordinated experiments even as understanding of how best to infer radiative forcing has evolved. The Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) endorsed by CMIP6 seeks to provide a foundation for answering the question through three related activities: (i) accurate characterization of the effective radiative forcing relative to a near-preindustrial baseline and careful diagnosis of the components of this forcing; (ii) assessment of the absolute accuracy of clear-sky radiative transfer parameterizations against reference models on the global scales relevant for climate modeling; and (iii) identification of robust model responses to tightly specified aerosol radiative forcing from 1850 to present. 

 Complete characterization of effective radiative forcing can be accomplished with 180 years (Tier 1) of atmosphere-only simulation using a sea-surface temperature and sea ice concentration climatology derived from the host model's preindustrial control simulation. Assessment of parameterization error requires trivial amounts of computation but the development of small amounts of infrastructure: new, spectrally detailed diagnostic output requested as two snapshots at present-day and preindustrial conditions, and results from the model's radiation code applied to specified atmospheric conditions. The search for robust responses to aerosol changes relies on the CMIP6 specification of anthropogenic aerosol properties; models using this specification can contribute to RFMIP with no additional simulation, while those using a full aerosol model are requested to perform at least one and up to four 165-year coupled ocean–atmosphere simulations at Tier 1.},

	abstract = {The effective radiative forcing, which includes the instantaneous forcing plus adjustments from the atmosphere and surface, has emerged as the key metric of evaluating human and natural influence on the climate. We evaluate effective radiative forcing and adjustments in 17 contemporary climate models that are participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and have contributed to the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP). Present-day (2014) global-mean anthropogenic forcing relative to pre-industrial (1850) levels from climate models stands at 2.00 (±0.23) W\&thinsp;m−2, comprised of 1.81 (±0.09) W\&thinsp;m−2 from CO2, 1.08 (± 0.21) W\&thinsp;m−2 from other well-mixed greenhouse gases, −1.01 (± 0.23) W\&thinsp;m−2 from aerosols and −0.09 (±0.13) W\&thinsp;m−2 from land use change. Quoted uncertainties are 1 standard deviation across model best estimates, and 90\&thinsp;\% confidence in the reported forcings, due to internal variability, is typically within 0.1 W\&thinsp;m−2. The majority of the remaining 0.21\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m−2 is likely to be from ozone. In most cases, the largest contributors to the spread in effective radiative forcing (ERF) is from the instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) and from cloud responses, particularly aerosol–cloud interactions to aerosol forcing. As determined in previous studies, cancellation of tropospheric and surface adjustments means that the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing is approximately equal to ERF for greenhouse gas forcing but not for aerosols, and consequentially, not for the anthropogenic total. The spread of aerosol forcing ranges from −0.63 to −1.37\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m−2, exhibiting a less negative mean and narrower range compared to 10 CMIP5 models. The spread in 4×CO2 forcing has also narrowed in CMIP6 compared to 13 CMIP5 models. Aerosol forcing is uncorrelated with climate sensitivity. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the increasing spread in climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models, particularly related to high-sensitivity models, is a consequence of a stronger negative present-day aerosol forcing and little evidence that modelling groups are systematically tuning climate sensitivity or aerosol forcing to recreate observed historical warming.},

Previous best-guess estimates of known drivers, including anthropogenic warming and the El Niño onset, fall short by about 0.2 kelvin in explaining the temperature rise. Using satellite and reanalysis data, we identified a record-low planetary albedo as the primary factor bridging this gap. The decline is apparently caused largely by a reduced low-cloud cover in the northern mid-latitudes and tropics, in continuation of a multiannual trend. Further exploring the low-cloud trend and understanding how much of it is due to internal variability, reduced aerosol concentrations, or a possibly emerging low-cloud feedback will be crucial for assessing the present and expected future warming.

            This study investigates the transient evolution of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) responses to a constant northern high-latitude solar heating in fully coupled CESM 1.2. The study identifies two stages through multiple ensemble runs. 1) In the first 3 years, a hemispherically asymmetric pattern emerges, caused by air–sea interactions associated with the anomalous cross-equatorial Hadley cell. The northern tropics experience warming that is blocked north of the equator by the intertropical convergence zone. The southeast Pacific cooling reaches the equatorial region and is amplified by the equatorial Ekman divergence. 2) Within a decade, the equatorial cooling is replaced by warming in the eastern equatorial basin. The anomalous warming that appears faster than the time scales of the oceanic ventilation is attributed to anomalous meridional heat convergence and weakening of the northern subtropical cell. Our findings highlight the influence of ocean dynamics on the temporal and spatial evolution of tropical SST response to hemispherically asymmetric heating. The initial cooling caused by Ekman divergence delays the arrival of slow warming, while initial wind and temperature anomalies set the stage for the weakening of the subtropical cell. The results have important implications for understanding the evolution of tropical SST patterns in observational records and future climate change simulations, as they show strong interhemispheric temperature asymmetry in the extratropics.},

While anthropogenic aerosols have been suggested as a cause, the prolonged cooling trend over the equatorial Pacific appears in conflict with Northern Hemisphere aerosol emission reduction since the 1980s. Here, using CESM, we show that the superposition of fast and slow responses to aerosol emission change—an increase followed by a decrease—can sustain the La Niña-like condition for a longer time than expected. The rapid adjustment of Hadley Cell to aerosol reduction triggers joint feedback between low clouds, wind, evaporation, and sea surface temperature in the Southeast Pacific, leading to a wedge-shaped cooling that extends to the central equatorial Pacific. Meanwhile, the northern subtropical cell gradually intensifies, resulting in equatorial subsurface cooling that lasts for decades.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Global anthropogenic emission inventories remain vital
for understanding the sources of atmospheric pollution and the associated impacts on the environment, human health, and society.
Rapid changes in today's society require that these inventories provide
contemporary estimates of multiple atmospheric pollutants with both source
sector and fuel type information to understand and effectively mitigate
future impacts. To fill this need, we have updated the open-source Community
Emissions Data System (CEDS) (Hoesly et al., 2019) to
develop a new global emission inventory, CEDSGBD-MAPS. This inventory
includes emissions of seven key atmospheric pollutants (NOx; CO;
SO2; NH3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOCs; black carbon, BC; organic carbon, OC) over the time period from 1970–2017
and reports annual country-total emissions as a function of 11 anthropogenic
sectors (agriculture; energy generation; industrial processes;
on-road and non-road transportation; separate residential, commercial, and other
sectors (RCO); waste; solvent use; and international shipping) and four fuel
categories (total coal, solid biofuel, the sum of liquid-fuel and
natural-gas combustion, and remaining process-level emissions). The
CEDSGBD-MAPS inventory additionally includes monthly global gridded
(0.5∘ × 0.5∘) emission fluxes for each compound, sector, and fuel type to facilitate their
use in earth system models. CEDSGBD-MAPS utilizes updated activity
data, updates to the core CEDS default scaling procedure, and modifications
to the final procedures for emissions gridding and aggregation. Relative to the previous CEDS inventory (Hoesly et
al., 2018), these updates extend the emission estimates from 2014 to 2017
and improve the overall agreement between CEDS and two widely used global
bottom-up emission inventories. The CEDSGBD-MAPS inventory provides the
most contemporary global emission estimates to date for these key
atmospheric pollutants and is the first to provide global estimates for
these species as a function of multiple fuel types and source
sectors. Dominant sources of global NOx and SO2 emissions in 2017
include the combustion of oil, gas, and coal in the energy and industry
sectors as well as on-road transportation and international shipping for
NOx. Dominant sources of global CO emissions in 2017 include on-road
transportation and residential biofuel combustion. Dominant global sources
of carbonaceous aerosol in 2017 include residential biofuel combustion,
on-road transportation (BC only), and emissions from the waste
sector. Global emissions of NOx, SO2, CO, BC, and OC all peak in
2012 or earlier, with more recent emission reductions driven by large
changes in emissions from China, North America, and Europe. In contrast,
global emissions of NH3 and NMVOCs continuously increase between 1970
and 2017, with agriculture as a major source of global NH3
emissions and solvent use, energy, residential, and the on-road transport
sectors as major sources of global NMVOCs. Due to similar development
methods and underlying datasets, the CEDSGBD-MAPS emissions are
expected to have consistent sources of uncertainty as other bottom-up
inventories. The CEDSGBD-MAPS source
code is publicly available online through GitHub:
https://github.com/emcduffie/CEDS/tree/CEDS\_GBD-MAPS (last access: 1 December 2020). The

Climatologically, greater reflection by the surface, aerosols, and high clouds in the Northern Hemisphere is balanced by greater low and mid-level cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere. Both hemispheres have darkened at similar rates over the past two decades; whether the darkening from more rapidly declining aerosol in the Northern Hemisphere is causing a departure from all-sky symmetry remains uncertain. Natural experiments including long-term trends, sea ice loss, and volcanic eruptions provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that extratropical low clouds compensate changing clear-sky asymmetries on annual-to-decadal timescales but some evidence that tropical high cloud shifts may do so.},

              . Analysis of recent temperature anomalies indicates Northern Hemisphere surface temperature anomalies in 2022–2023 are correlated with observed cloud radiative forcing and the cloud radiative forcing is spatially correlated with the simulated radiative forcing from the 2020 shipping emission changes. Shipping emissions changes could be accelerating global warming. To better constrain these estimates, better access to ship position data and understanding of ship aerosol emissions are needed. Understanding the risks and benefits of emissions reductions and the difficultly in robust attribution highlights the large uncertainty in attributing proposed deliberate climate intervention.

            Plain Language Summary
            Ships have a unique climate effect due to brightening of low marine clouds, resulting in visible “ship tracks”. These ship tracks are due to clouds interacting with ship emissions, particularly sulfur. Recently, regulations have drastically reduced allowable ship sulfur emissions. This has resulted in a decrease in observable ship tracks. Modeling and observations indicate that the reduction in ship sulfur emissions could have slightly warmed the planet starting in 2020. These changes are remarkably co‐incident with observed patterns of cloud changes and may have accelerated global warming.

	abstract = {The Earth’s energy imbalance is the net radiative flux at the top-of-atmosphere. Climate model simulations suggest that the observed positive imbalance trend in the previous two decades is inconsistent with internal variability alone and caused by anthropogenic forcing and the resulting climate system response. Here, we investigate anthropogenic contributions to the imbalance trend using climate models forced with observed sea-surface temperatures. We find that the effective radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosol emission reductions has led to a 0.2 ± 0.1 W m−2 decade−1 strengthening of the 2001–2019 imbalance trend. The multi-model ensemble reproduces the observed imbalance trend of 0.47 ± 0.17 W m−2 decade−1 but with 10-40\% underestimation. With most future scenarios showing further rapid reductions of aerosol emissions due to air quality legislation, such emission reductions may continue to strengthen Earth’s energy imbalance, on top of the greenhouse gas contribution. Consequently, we may expect an accelerated surface temperature warming in this decade.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Improving observations of ocean heat content show that Earth is absorbing more energy from the Sun than it is radiating to space as heat, even during the recent solar minimum. The inferred planetary energy imbalance, 0.58 ± 0.15 W m−2 during the 6-yr period 2005–2010, confirms the dominant role of the human-made greenhouse effect in driving global climate change. Observed surface temperature change and ocean heat gain together constrain the net climate forcing and ocean mixing rates. We conclude that most climate models mix heat too efficiently into the deep ocean and as a result underestimate the negative forcing by human-made aerosols. Aerosol climate forcing today is inferred to be −1.6 ± 0.3 W m−2, implying substantial aerosol indirect climate forcing via cloud changes. Continued failure to quantify the specific origins of this large forcing is untenable, as knowledge of changing aerosol effects is needed to understand future climate change. We conclude that recent slowdown of ocean heat uptake was caused by a delayed rebound effect from Mount Pinatubo aerosols and a deep prolonged solar minimum. Observed sea level rise during the Argo float era is readily accounted for by ice melt and ocean thermal expansion, but the ascendency of ice melt leads us to anticipate acceleration of the rate of sea level rise this decade.},

	abstract = {Stratocumulus is one of the most common cloud types globally, with a profound effect on the earth’s radiation budget, and the drizzle process is fundamental in understanding the evolution of these boundary layer clouds. In this paper a combination of 94-GHz Doppler radar and backscatter lidar is used to investigate the microphysical properties of drizzle falling below the base of stratocumulus clouds. The ratio of the radar to lidar backscatter power is proportional to the fourth power of mean size, and so potentially it can provide an accurate size estimate. Information about the shape of the drop size distribution is then inferred from the Doppler spectral width. The algorithm estimates vertical profiles of drizzle parameters such as liquid water content, liquid water flux, and vertical air velocity, assuming that the drizzle size spectrum may be represented by a gamma distribution. The depletion time scale of cloud liquid water through the drizzle process can be estimated when the liquid water path of the cloud is available from microwave radiometers, and observations suggest that this time scale varies from a few days in light drizzle to a few hours in strong drizzle events. Radar and lidar observations from Chilbolton (in southern England) and aircraft size spectra taken during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment have both been used to derive the following power-law relationship between liquid water flux (LWF) (g m−2 s−1) and radar reflectivity (Z) (mm6 m−3): LWF = 0.0093Z0.69. This relation is valid for frequencies up to 94 GHz and therefore would allow a forthcoming spaceborne radar to measure liquid water flux around the globe to within a factor of 2 for values of Z above −20 dBZ.},

            The extent to which the climate will change due to an external forcing depends largely on radiative feedbacks, which act to amplify or damp the surface temperature response. There are a variety of issues that complicate the analysis of radiative feedbacks in global climate models, resulting in some confusion regarding their strengths and distributions. In this paper, the authors present a method for quantifying climate feedbacks based on “radiative kernels” that describe the differential response of the top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes to incremental changes in the feedback variables. The use of radiative kernels enables one to decompose the feedback into one factor that depends on the radiative transfer algorithm and the unperturbed climate state and a second factor that arises from the climate response of the feedback variables. Such decomposition facilitates an understanding of the spatial characteristics of the feedbacks and the causes of intermodel differences. This technique provides a simple and accurate way to compare feedbacks across different models using a consistent methodology. Cloud feedbacks cannot be evaluated directly from a cloud radiative kernel because of strong nonlinearities, but they can be estimated from the change in cloud forcing and the difference between the full-sky and clear-sky kernels. The authors construct maps to illustrate the regional structure of the feedbacks and compare results obtained using three different model kernels to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology. The results confirm that models typically generate globally averaged cloud feedbacks that are substantially positive or near neutral, unlike the change in cloud forcing itself, which is as often negative as positive.},

            Radiative kernels describe the differential response of radiative fluxes to small perturbations in state variables and are widely used to quantify radiative feedbacks on the climate system. Radiative kernels have traditionally been generated using simulated data from a global climate model, typically sourced from the model's base climate. Consequently, these radiative kernels are subject to model bias from the climatological fields used to produce them. Here, we introduce the first observation‐based temperature, water vapor, and surface albedo radiative kernels, developed from CloudSat's fluxes and heating rates data set, 2B‐FLXHR‐LIDAR, which is supplemented with cloud information from the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). We compare the radiative kernels to a previously published set generated from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model and find general agreement in magnitude and structure. However, several key differences illustrate the sensitivity of radiative kernels to the distribution of clouds. The radiative kernels are used to quantify top‐of‐atmosphere and surface cloud feedbacks in an ensemble of global climate models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, showing that biases in the GFDL low clouds likely cause the GFDL kernel to underestimate longwave surface cloud feedback. Since the CloudSat kernels are free of model bias in the base state, they will be ideal for future analysis of radiative feedbacks and forcing in both models and observations and for evaluating biases in model‐derived radiative kernels.

Next, we overview the existing theories of diffusion models, covering their statistical properties and sampling capabilities. We adopt a progressive routine, beginning with unconditional diffusion models and connecting to conditional counterparts. Further, we review a new avenue in high-dimensional structured optimization through conditional diffusion models, where searching for solutions is reformulated as a conditional sampling problem and solved by diffusion models.

We find that mean-state biases in albedo symmetry and hemispheric surface temperature asymmetry correlate negatively.

This is true across many and within single climate model simulations: a too warm or stronger warming hemisphere is darker or darkens more than its counterpart.

	abstract = {The properties of Earth's albedo and its symmetries are analyzed using twenty years of space-based Energy Balanced And Filled product of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System measurements. Despite surface asymmetries, top of the atmosphere temporally \& hemispherically averaged reflected solar irradiance R appears symmetric over Northern/Southern hemispheres. This is confirmed with the use of surrogate time-series, which provides margins of 0.1±0.28Wm−2 for possible hemispheric differences supported by Clouds and Earth's Radiant System data. R time-series are further analyzed by decomposition into a seasonal (yearly and half yearly) cycle and residuals. Variability in the reflected solar irradiance is almost entirely (99\%) due to the seasonal variations, mostly due to seasonal variations in insolation. The residuals of hemispherically averaged R are not only small, but also indistinguishable from noise, and thus not correlated across hemispheres. This makes yearly and sub-yearly timescales unlikely as the basis for a symmetry-establishing mechanism. The residuals however contain a global trend that is large, as compared to expected albedo feedbacks. It is also hemispherically symmetric, and thus indicates the possibility of a symmetry enforcing mechanism at longer timescales. To pinpoint precisely which parts of the Earth system establish the hemispheric symmetry, we create an energetically consistent cloud-albedo field from the data. We show that the surface albedo asymmetry is compensated by asymmetries between clouds over extra-tropical oceans, with southern hemispheric storm-tracks being 11\% cloudier than their northern hemisphere counterparts. This again indicates that, assuming the albedo symmetry is not a result of chance, its mechanism likely operates on large temporal and spatial scales.},

	abstract = {A striking feature of the Earth system is that the Northern and Southern Hemispheres reflect identical amounts of sunlight. This hemispheric albedo symmetry comprises two asymmetries: The Northern Hemisphere is more reflective in clear skies, whereas the Southern Hemisphere is cloudier. Here we show that the hemispheric reflection contrast from differences in continental coverage is offset by greater reflection from the Antarctic than the Arctic, allowing the net clear-sky asymmetry to be dominated by aerosol. Climate model simulations suggest that historical anthropogenic aerosol emissions drove a large increase in the clear-sky asymmetry that would reverse in future low-emission scenarios. High-emission scenarios also show decreasing asymmetry, instead driven by declines in Northern Hemisphere ice and snow cover. Strong clear-sky hemispheric albedo asymmetry is therefore a transient feature of Earth’s climate. If all-sky symmetry is maintained, compensating cloud changes would have uncertain but important implications for Earth’s energy balance and hydrological cycle.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols exert a cooling influence that offsets part of the greenhouse gas warming. Due to their short tropospheric lifetime of only several days, the aerosol forcing responds quickly to emissions. Here, we present and discuss the evolution of the aerosol forcing since 2000. There are multiple lines of evidence that allow us to robustly conclude that the anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) – both aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) – has become less negative globally, i.e. the trend in aerosol effective radiative forcing changed sign from negative to positive. Bottom-up inventories show that anthropogenic primary aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions declined in most regions of the world; observations related to aerosol burden show declining trends, in particular of the fine-mode particles that make up most of the anthropogenic aerosols; satellite retrievals of cloud droplet numbers show trends in regions with aerosol declines that are consistent with these in sign, as do observations of top-of-atmosphere radiation. Climate model results, including a revised set that is constrained by observations of the ocean heat content evolution show a consistent sign and magnitude for a positive forcing relative to the year 2000 due to reduced aerosol effects. This reduction leads to an acceleration of the forcing of climate change, i.e. an increase in forcing by 0.1 to 0.3 W m−2, up to 12 \% of the total climate forcing in 2019 compared to 1750 according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).},

Under-resourced, highly populated regions often bear the brunt of aerosols’ climate and air quality effects, amplifying risk through heightened exposure and vulnerability. However, many policy-facing evaluations of near-term climate risk, including those in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report, underrepresent aerosols’ complex and regionally diverse climate effects, reducing them to a globally averaged offset to greenhouse gas warming. We argue that this constitutes a major missing element in society’s ability to prepare for future climate change. We outline a pathway towards progress and call for greater interaction between the aerosol research, impact modeling, scenario development, and risk assessment communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFaci) is difficult to quantify, leading to large uncertainties in model projections of historical forcing and climate sensitivity. In this study, satellite observations and reanalysis data are used to examine the low-level cloud radiative responses to aerosols. While some studies it is assumed that the activation rate of cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) in response to variations in sulfate aerosols (SO4) or the aerosol index (AI) has a one-to-one relationship in the estimation of ERFaci, we find this assumption to be incorrect, and demonstrate that explicitly accounting for the activation rate is crucial for accurate ERFaci estimation. This is corroborated through a “perfect-model” cross validation using state-of-the-art climate models, which compares our estimates with the “true” ERFaci. Our results suggest a smaller and less uncertain value of the global ERFaci than previous studies (-0.39 ± 0.29 W m-2 for SO4 and -0.24 ± 0.18 W m-2 for AI, 90 \% confidence), indicating that ERFaci may be less impactful than previously thought. Our results are also consistent with observationally constrained estimates of total cloud feedback and “top-down” estimates that models with weaker ERFaci better match the observed hemispheric warming asymmetry over the historical period.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The diurnal susceptibility of clouds to aerosols is examined during the transition from subtropical stratocumulus to shallow cumulus regimes. Using large-eddy simulations, a six-day air mass evolution along a 3800-km observed trajectory from the coast of Peru toward the equator is analyzed. Pristine and polluted scenarios are simulated with forcing imposed from weather reanalysis. The polluted scenario exhibits stronger diurnal variations in cloud water, cloud fraction, and albedo, with enhanced entrainment and suppressed precipitation. The overall response of cloud properties and outgoing shortwave radiation to droplet number concentration follows a distinct diurnal pattern: strong positive adjustments dominate at night and in the morning, while weak negative adjustments prevail in the afternoon. This cycle is driven by the competition between precipitation suppression, which enhances cloud water and coverage, and entrainment drying, which depletes them. In polluted conditions, enhanced entrainment leads to a deeper and more decoupled boundary layer that cannot be sustained by surface fluxes in the afternoon, resulting in negative cloud adjustments. This entrainment enhancement is mediated by the sedimentation of cloud and precipitation water from the entrainment zone. While the Twomey effect dominates the diurnal average albedo response, the diurnal variation in the competing cloud adjustments lead to a near-neutral net adjustment effect, highlighting the critical role of diurnal processes in aerosol-cloud interactions.},

Although exposure is commonly attributed to traffic exhaust, monitored students in Ghana showed the highest exposures in a home near a trash burning site, in a bedroom with burning coils employed to abate mosquitos, in a home of an adult smoker, and in home kitchens during domestic cooking. The high point-source production and rapid redistribution make incidental exposure common, confound general population studies and are compounded by the lack of global standards and national reporting.

	abstract = {Abstract
            A continuous decrease in aerosols over the Western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO) on a decadal timescale provides a long‐term benchmark to evaluate how various natural and anthropogenic processes affect the manifestation of aerosol‐cloud interactions in this region. Furthermore, the WNAO serves as a natural laboratory with diverse aerosol sources, marine boundary layer clouds more variable than those in marine stratocumulus deck regions, and unique flow regimes established by the Gulf Stream and the semi‐permanent Bermuda High. We investigate how satellite‐retrieved macrophysical and microphysical properties of low clouds and the surface shortwave irradiance changed from 2003 to 2020, in tandem with this aerosol decrease. The decadal changes in large‐scale meteorology related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are also examined. We find a reduction in low‐cloud optical thickness, accompanied by fewer and larger cloud droplets, yet observe no significant changes in low‐cloud fraction and liquid water path. Despite the reduction in low‐cloud optical thickness together with aerosol decrease, a corresponding increase in the trends of surface shortwave irradiance, also known as surface brightening, is lacking. This absence of brightening is potentially related to concomitant changes found in large‐scale meteorology associated with NAO—Bermuda High strengthening, sea surface warming, and atmospheric moistening— as well as an increase in high‐level cloud fraction that can counteract the surface brightening. Ultimately, our findings suggest that spatial patterns of decadal meteorological variability introduce complexities in the surface cloud radiative effect over the WNAO, thereby complicating the isolation and examination of aerosol‐cloud interactions.

            Plain Language Summary
            Over recent decades, the Western North Atlantic Ocean has experienced a steady decrease in aerosols—tiny particles in the air. This situation offers a chance to study how natural phenomena and human activities influence cloud‐aerosol interactions. The area is known for its diverse aerosol sources, complex cloud types, and distinct oceanic and atmospheric flow patterns influenced by the Gulf Stream and Bermuda High. By analyzing satellite data from 2003 to 2020, we investigated how low‐lying clouds and sunlight penetration have changed in response to fewer aerosols, and how the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) affects weather patterns. Our findings show that while low‐lying clouds have become more transparent with fewer, larger droplets, their coverage and juiciness have not changed significantly. Contrary to expectations, these changes have not lead to an increase in sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, a phenomenon known as “surface brightening.” This could be due to NAO‐related warmer sea surfaces, increased moisture, and more high‐level clouds, which might obscure any brightening. Our study shows that weather shifts in the Western North Atlantic Ocean add complexity to understanding how clouds influence sunlight, challenging the study of aerosol‐cloud interactions.

            Ship‐tracks are important natural/opportunistic experiments to study aerosol‐cloud interactions (ACIs). However, detectable ship‐tracks are not produced in many instances. Virtual ship‐tracks have been conceived to expand the scale of ACIs analyses. Cloud responses in virtual ship‐tracks differ strongly from those of detected ones. Here we show that the current approach of virtual ship‐tracks can lead to systematic biases and errors and suggest necessary improvements. Errors in trajectory modeling introduce mismatches between areas actually affected by ship‐emissions and virtual ship‐track locations, that is, positional errors. Positional errors systematically underestimate ACI signals and the underestimate is severe as indicated by analysis of cloud droplet number concentration changes. The assumption of fixed ship‐track width also systematically diminishes resulting aerosol effects by more than 10\%, which leads to a forcing difference of around 0.1 . We make suggestions to improve the simulation of virtual ship‐tracks so that their full potential for studying ACIs can be unleashed.

            Plain Language Summary
            Ship‐tracks are ideal opportunistic experiments that help us understand aerosol‐cloud interactions. However, most ships do not produce detectable ship‐tracks. Virtual ship‐tracks have been conceived to expand the scale of analyses and have revealed new insights. We show here that current methods of virtual ship‐tracks has two major errors that systematically bias aerosol‐cloud interaction results. We suggest ways to reduce these errors and realize the potential of virtual ship‐tracks.

	abstract = {The tropical intraseasonal variability in an idealized moist general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a slab ocean is investigated. The model has a simple moist convection scheme and realistic radiative transfer, but no parameterization of cloud processes. In a zonally symmetric aquaplanet state, variability is dominated by westward-propagating Rossby waves. Enforcing zonal asymmetry through the application of a prescribed ocean heat flux in the bottom boundary leads to the development of a slow, eastward propagating mode that bears some of the characteristics of the observed Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). When the ocean heat flux is made stronger, high-frequency Kelvin waves exist alongside the MJO mode. The strength of the disturbances and the spatial distribution of their precipitation anomalies are sensitive to the strength of intraseasonal sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The greatest resemblance to the MJO is observed when shallow slab ocean depths (1 m) are used, but the mode still exists at deeper slabs. Sensitivity experiments to the parameters of the convection scheme suggest that the simulated MJO mode couples to convection in a way that is distinct from both Kelvin and Rossby waves generated by the model. Analysis of the column moist static energy (CMSE) budget of the MJO mode suggests that column radiative heating plays only a weak role in destabilizing the mode relative to the stabilizing contribution of vertical advection. The CMSE budget analysis highlights the importance of the life cycle of horizontal advection for the destabilization and propagation of the MJO. Synergies between the generated MJO mode and linear theories of the MJO are discussed as well.},

            The regional haze over the southeast (SE) Atlantic Ocean induced by biomass burning in southern Africa can be problematic for passive imager‐based retrievals of the underlying quasi‐permanent marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds and for estimates of top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE). Here an algorithm is introduced to simultaneously retrieve above‐cloud aerosol optical thickness (AOT), the cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud effective particle radius (CER) of the underlying MBL clouds while also providing pixel‐level estimates of retrieval uncertainty. This approach utilizes reflectance measurements at six Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) channels from the visible to the shortwave infrared. Retrievals are run under two aerosol model assumptions on 8 years (2006–2013) of June–October Aqua MODIS data over the SE Atlantic, from which a regional cloud and above‐cloud aerosol climatology is produced. The cloud retrieval methodology is shown to yield COT and CER consistent with those from the MODIS operational cloud product (MOD06) when forcing AOT to zero, while the full COT‐CER‐AOT retrievals that account for the above‐cloud aerosol attenuation increase regional monthly mean COT and CER by up to 9\% and 2\%, respectively. Retrieved AOT is roughly 3 to 5 times larger than the collocated 532 nm Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) retrievals, though closer agreement is observed with the CALIOP 1064 nm retrievals, a result consistent with previous case study analyses. Regional cloudy‐sky above‐cloud aerosol DRE calculations are also performed that illustrate the importance of the aerosol model assumption and underlying cloud retrievals.

	abstract = {A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data (robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting, and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models. Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals. Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in the physical world.},

	abstract = {Estimates of the anthropogenic effective radiative forcing (ERF) trend have increased by 50\% since 2000 (from +0.4 W m−2 decade−1 in 2000–09 to +0.6 W m−2 decade−1 in 2010–19), the majority of which is driven by changes in the aerosol ERF trend, as a result of aerosol emissions reductions. Here we study the extent to which observations of the climate system agree with these ERF assumptions. We use a large ERF ensemble from the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) to attribute the anthropogenic contributions to global mean surface temperature (GMST), top-of-atmosphere radiative flux, and we use aerosol optical depth observations. The GMST trend has increased from +0.18°C decade−1 in 2000–09 to +0.35°C decade−1 in 2010–19, coinciding with the anthropogenic warming trend rising from +0.19°C decade−1 in 2000–09 to +0.24°C decade−1 in 2010–19. This, as well as observed trends in top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes and aerosol optical depths, supports the claim of an aerosol-induced temporary acceleration in the rate of warming. However, all three observation datasets additionally suggest that smaller aerosol ERF trend changes are compatible with observations since 2000, since radiative flux and GMST trends are significantly influenced by internal variability over this period. A zero-trend-change aerosol ERF scenario results in a much smaller anthropogenic warming acceleration since 2000 but is poorly represented in AR6’s ERF ensemble. Short-term ERF trends are difficult to verify using observations, so caution is required in predictions or policy judgments that depend on them, such as estimates of current anthropogenic warming trend, and the time remaining to, or the outstanding carbon budget consistent with, 1.5°C warming. Further systematic research focused on quantifying trends and early identification of acceleration or deceleration is required.},

During the eruption cloud droplet effective radius (re) over the region surrounding Iceland was at the lowest value in the 14 year Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer data record during September and October 2014. The change in reflected solar radiation due to increased cloud reflectivity during September and October is estimated to exceed 2 W m−2 over the region surrounding Iceland, with increases of 1 W m−2 extending as far south as the Açores.

This study provides an assessment of the radiometric calibration stability and consistency of Terra and Aqua MODIS RSB using the L1B from the upcoming Collection 7 release. Several independent vicarious approaches based on measurements from the Libya-4 desert, Dome C, DCC, and SNO are used to assess the calibration stability at the beginning of scan, nadir, and end of scan. Results indicate that both Terra and Aqua RSB are stable to within 1\% over their mission periods. Comparison of the normalized reflectances with either a BRDF model or a common reference sensor provides a radiometric assessment of Terra and Aqua calibration consistency. Comparison results show the VIS/NIR bands are in good agreement around the nadir and at the beginning of the scan for all the approaches. For cases at the end of the scan, the agreement varies depending on the approach but is typically within ±2\%. The differences observed in the SWIR bands are slightly larger than the VIS/NIR bands, which are likely due to their high sensitivity to atmospheric conditions and relatively larger electronic crosstalk impact on the Terra instrument.},

Although Aqua MODIS, designed with a lifetime requirement of 6 years, is currently operated in its extended mission phase, it continues to make high quality global observations of the Earth’s surface via its 36 spectral bands that cover wavelengths from visible to long-wave infrared. To date, all instrument on-board calibrators (OBC) remain capable of performing their design functions, providing various calibration data sets to help monitor on-orbit changes in sensor responses and performance characteristics. In addition to the OBC, regularly scheduled lunar observations and select Earth-view targets are used extensively to support sensor on-orbit calibration, especially for the calibration of the visible channels (or bands). We provide an overview of Aqua MODIS on-orbit calibration activities and methodologies for both reflective solar bands and thermal emissive bands, illustrate its on-orbit performance over the past 20 years using examples derived from OBC measurements, lunar observations, and Earth-view response trends, and describe various calibration improvements made over its entire mission. We focus on key issues identified since launch, such as solar diffuser degradation, electronic crosstalk, and on-orbit changes in sensor response versus scan-angle, along with approaches and strategies developed to mitigate their impact on sensor calibration quality. Also discussed in this paper are some of the key calibration enhancements incorporated recently in the Collection 6.1 and the upcoming Collection 7 Level-1B algorithms.},

We find that the time history of aerosol ERFs diagnosed in CMIP6 models exhibits considerable variation and explore how the time history of aerosol forcing influences the probability distributions of present-day aerosol forcing and emergent metrics such as climate sensitivity. Using a simple energy balance model, trained on CMIP6 climate models and constrained by observed near-surface warming and ocean heat uptake, we derive estimates for the historical aerosol forcing. We find 2005–2014 mean aerosol ERF to be −1.1 (−1.8 to −0.5) W m−2 relative to 1750. Assuming recently published historical emissions from fossil fuel and industrial sectors and biomass burning emissions from SSP2-4.5, aerosol ERF in 2019 is −0.9 (−1.5 to −0.4) W m−2. There is a modest recovery in aerosol forcing (+0.025 W m−2 decade−1) between 1980 and 2014. This analysis also gives a 5\%–95\% range of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.8°C –5.1°C (best estimate 3.1°C) with a transient climate response of 1.2°C –2.6°C (best estimate 1.8°C).},

The climatology provides monthly mean 1 × 1° CDNC values plus associated uncertainties over the global ice-free oceans. All values are in-cloud values, i.e. the reported CDNC value will be valid for the cloudy part of the grid box. Here, we provide an overview of how the climatology was generated and assess and quantify potential systematic error sources including effects of broken clouds, and remaining artefacts caused by the retrieval process or related to observation geometry. Retrievals and evaluations were performed at the scale of initial MODIS observations (in contrast to some earlier climatologies, which were created based on already gridded data). This allowed us to implement additional screening criteria, so that observations inconsistent with key assumptions made in the CDNC retrieval could be rejected. Application of these additional screening criteria led to significant changes in the annual cycle of CDNC in terms of both its phase and magnitude. After an optimal screening was established a final CDNC climatology was generated. Resulting CDNC uncertainties are reported as monthly-mean standard deviations of CDNC over each 1 × 1° grid box. These uncertainties are of the order of 30 \% in the stratocumulus regions and 60 to 80 \% elsewhere.},

Even so, the issue continues to be widely ignored, leading routinely to overstatement and overinterpretation of scientific results, to the detriment of the discipline.

Beyond the TOA, additional CO2 increases downwelling longwave at the surface, and this change in flux is the surface CO2 forcing. Here we thoroughly evaluate the spatiotemporal variation of the instantaneous, longwave CO2 radiative forcing at both the TOA and surface. The instantaneous forcing is calculated with a radiative transfer model using ERA5 reanalysis fields. Multivariate regression models show that the broadband forcing at the TOA and surface are well predicted by local temperatures, humidity, and cloud radiative effects. The difference between the TOA and surface forcing, the atmospheric forcing, can be either positive or negative and is mostly controlled by the column water vapor, with little explicit dependence on the surface temperature. The role of local variables on the TOA forcing is also assessed by partitioning the change in radiative flux to the component emitted by the surface versus that emitted by the atmosphere. In cold, dry regions, the surface and atmospheric contribution partially cancel out, leading to locally weak or even negative TOA forcing. In contrast, in the warm, moist regions, the surface and atmospheric components strengthen each other, resulting in overall larger TOA forcing. The relative contributions of surface and atmosphere to the TOA forcing depend on the optical thickness in the current climate, which in turn is controlled by the column water vapor.},

This cooling due to sulfate aerosol offsets some of the warming effect of greenhouse gasses and is the largest uncertainty in determining the change in the Earth’s radiative balance by human activity. Ship tracks—the visible manifestation of the indirect of effect of ship emissions on clouds as quasi-linear features—have long provided an opportunity to quantify these effects. However, they have been arduous to catalog and typically studied only in particular regions for short periods of time. Using a machine-learning algorithm to automate their detection we catalog more than 1 million ship tracks to provide a global climatology. We use this to investigate the effect of stringent fuel regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organization in 2020 on their global prevalence since then, while accounting for the disruption in global commerce caused by COVID-19.

            Feedbacks in response to climate variations during the period 2000–10 have been calculated using reanalysis meteorological fields and top-of-atmosphere flux measurements. Over this period, the climate was stabilized by a strongly negative temperature feedback ({\textasciitilde}−3 W m−2 K−1); climate variations were also amplified by a strong positive water vapor feedback ({\textasciitilde}+1.2 W m−2 K−1) and smaller positive albedo and cloud feedbacks ({\textasciitilde}+0.3 and +0.5 W m−2 K−1, respectively). These observations are compared to two climate model ensembles, one dominated by internal variability (the control ensemble) and the other dominated by long-term global warming (the A1B ensemble). The control ensemble produces global average feedbacks that agree within uncertainties with the observations, as well as producing similar spatial patterns. The most significant discrepancy was in the spatial pattern for the total (shortwave + longwave) cloud feedback. Feedbacks calculated from the A1B ensemble show a stronger negative temperature feedback (due to a stronger lapse-rate feedback), but that is cancelled by a stronger positive water vapor feedback. The feedbacks in the A1B ensemble tend to be more smoothly distributed in space, which is consistent with the differences between El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate variations and long-term global warming. The sum of all of the feedbacks, sometimes referred to as the thermal damping rate, is −1.15 ± 0.88 W m−2 K−1 in the observations and −0.60 ± 0.37 W m−2 K−1 in the control ensemble. Within the control ensemble, models that more accurately simulate ENSO tend to produce thermal damping rates closer to the observations. The A1B ensemble average thermal damping rate is −1.26 ± 0.45 W m−2 K−1.},

              The productivity of the Amazon rainforest is constrained by the availability of nutrients, in particular phosphorus (P). Deposition of long‐range transported African dust is recognized as a potentially important but poorly quantified source of phosphorus. This study provides a first multiyear satellite‐based estimate of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin using three‐dimensional (3‐D) aerosol measurements over 2007–2013 from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The 7 year average of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin is estimated to be 28 (8–48) Tg a

              . The dust deposition shows significant interannual variation that is negatively correlated with the prior‐year rainfall in the Sahel. The CALIOP‐based multiyear mean estimate of dust deposition matches better with estimates from in situ measurements and model simulations than a previous satellite‐based estimate does. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and inclusion of meridional dust transport calculation in addition to the 3‐D nature of CALIOP aerosol measurements. The imported dust could provide about 0.022 (0.006–0.037) Tg P of phosphorus per year, equivalent to 23 (7–39) g P ha

Four methods are proposed/adopted to derive the SSA by means of remote sensing and in situ observation, which varies drastically with time and space.

However, detecting aerosol effect on cloud amount has been elusive to both observations and modeling due to potential buffering mechanisms and convolution of meteorology. Here through a natural experiment provided by long-term degassing of a low-lying volcano and use of A-Train satellite observations, we show modifications of trade cumulus cloud fields including decreased droplet size, decreased precipitation efficiency and increased cloud amount are associated with volcanic aerosols. In addition we find significantly higher cloud tops for polluted clouds. We demonstrate that the observed microphysical and macrophysical changes cannot be explained by synoptic meteorology or the orographic effect of the Hawaiian Islands. The "total shortwave aerosol forcin", resulting from direct and indirect forcings including both cloud albedo and cloud amount, is almost an order of magnitude higher than aerosol direct forcing alone. Furthermore, the precipitation reduction associated with enhanced aerosol leads to large changes in the energetics of air-sea exchange and trade wind boundary layer. Our results represent the first observational evidence of large-scale increase of cloud amount due to aerosols in a trade cumulus regime, which can be used to constrain the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models. The findings also have implications for volcano-climate interactions and climate mitigation research.},

Approximately half of the dust and pollution over North America comes from Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Asian dust is the largest fraction of this total.

            Many types of aerosols have lifetimes long enough for their transcontinental transport, making them potentially important contributors to air quality and climate change in remote locations. We estimate that the mass of aerosols arriving at North American shores from overseas is comparable with the total mass of particulates emitted domestically. Curbing domestic emissions of particulates and precursor gases, therefore, is not sufficient to mitigate aerosol impacts in North America. The imported contribution is dominated by dust leaving Asia, not by combustion-generated particles. Thus, even a reduction of industrial emissions of the emerging economies of Asia could be overwhelmed by an increase of dust emissions due to changes in meteorological conditions and potential desertification.},

            Hurricane Irene (2011) moved northward along the eastern coast of the United States and was expected to cause severe wind and flood damage. However, the hurricane weakened much faster than was predicted. Moreover, the minimum pressure in Irene occurred, atypically, about 40 h later than the time of maximum wind speed. Possible reasons for Irene’s weakening and the time shift between maximum wind and minimum central pressure were studied in simulations using WRF with spectral bin microphysics (WRF-SBM) with 1-km grid spacing and ocean coupling. Both ocean coupling and aerosol distribution/concentration were found to influence Irene’s development. Without ocean coupling or with ocean coupling and uniform aerosol distribution, the simulated maximum wind occurred at about the same time as the minimum pressure. With ocean coupling and nonuniform spatial aerosol distributions caused by aerosols from the Saharan air layer (band) and the continental United States, the maximum wind occurred about 40 h before the simulated minimum pressure, in agreement with observations. Concentrations of aerosols of several hundred per cubic centimeter in the inner core were found to initially cause convection invigoration in the simulated eyewall. In contrast, a weakening effect dominated at the mature and the decaying stages, when aerosols from the band and land intensified convection at the simulated storm’s periphery. Simulations made with 3-km instead of 1-km grid spacing suggest that cloud-scale processes interactions are required to correctly simulate the timing differences between maximum wind and minimum pressure.},

Vertical profiles of cloud particle phase in tropical deep convective clouds (DCCs) were investigated using airborne solar spectral radiation data collected by the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO) during the ACRIDICON-CHUVA campaign, which was conducted over the Brazilian rainforest in September 2014. A phase discrimination retrieval based on imaging spectroradiometer measurements of DCC side spectral reflectivity was applied to clouds formed in different aerosol conditions. From the retrieval results the height of the mixed-phase layer of the DCCs was determined. The retrieved profiles were compared with in situ measurements and satellite observations. It was found that the depth and vertical position of the mixed-phase layer can vary up to 900 m for one single cloud scene. This variability is attributed to the different stages of cloud development in a scene. Clouds of mature or decaying stage are affected by falling ice particles resulting in lower levels of fully glaciated cloud layers compared to growing clouds. Comparing polluted and moderate aerosol conditions revealed a shift of the lower boundary of the mixed-phase layer from 5.6 ± 0.2 km (269 K; moderate) to 6.2 ± 0.3 km (267 K; polluted), and of the upper boundary from 6.8 ± 0.2 km (263 K; moderate) to 7.4 ± 0.4 km (259 K; polluted), as would be expected from theory.},

            Satellite measurements provide the only global‐scale picture of cloud properties and are widely used in the research community. Since the first comparisons of satellite and aircraft measurements of characteristic cloud drop size, significant disagreement between the two has been found. Past studies assumed that disagreement is because of faults in how the satellite observations are handled as opposed to issues with the aircraft measurements. In this study we show that which aircraft instrument is chosen for comparison with satellite measurements can affect whether satellite and aircraft measurements agree and that an appropriate choice of aircraft instrument leads to robust agreement between satellite and aircraft measurements. Using a database of over 200,000 aircraft measurements in cloud, we show why some aircraft instruments are unable to accurately measure cloud properties in certain meteorological settings.

	abstract = {Abstract. Volcanic eruptions in otherwise clean environments are “natural experiments” wherein the effects of aerosol emissions on clouds and climate can be partitioned from meteorological variability and anthropogenic activities. In this work, we combined satellite retrievals, reanalysis products, and atmospheric modeling to analyze the mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions during two degassing events at the Kilauea volcano in 2008 and 2018. The eruptive nature of the 2008 and 2018 degassing events was distinct from long-term volcanic activity for Kilauea. Although previous studies assessed the modulation of cloud properties from the 2008 event, this is the first time such an analysis has been reported for the 2018 event and that multiple degassing events have been analyzed and compared at this location. Both events resulted in significant changes in cloud effective radius and cloud droplet number concentration that were decoupled from local meteorology and in line with an enhanced cloud albedo. However, it is likely that the effects of volcanic emissions on liquid water path and cloud fraction were largely offset by meteorological variability. Comparison of cloud anomalies between the two events suggested a threshold response of aerosol–cloud interactions to overcome meteorological effects, largely controlled by aerosol loading. In both events, the ingestion of aerosols within convective parcels enhanced the detrainment of condensate in the upper troposphere, resulting in deeper clouds than observed under pristine conditions. Accounting for ice nucleation on ash particles led to enhanced ice crystal concentrations at cirrus levels and a slight decrease in ice water content, improving the correlation of the model results with the satellite retrievals. Overall, aerosol loading, plume characteristics, and meteorology contributed to changes in cloud properties during the Kilauea degassing events.},

combustion-related aerosol from burning fossil fuels and biomass vary from
year to year, driven by the evolution of the economy and changes in
meteorological conditions and environmental regulations. This study offers
both satellite and model perspectives on the interannual variability and
possible trends of combustion aerosol and dust in major continental outflow
regions over the past 15 years (2003–2017). The decade-long record of
aerosol optical depth (AOD, denoted as τ), separately for combustion
aerosol (τc) and dust (τd), over global oceans is
derived from the Collection 6 aerosol products of the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard both Terra and Aqua. These
MODIS Aqua datasets, complemented by aerosol source-tagged simulations using
the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5), are then analyzed to
understand the interannual variability and potential trends of τc
and τd in the major continental outflows. Both MODIS and CAM5
consistently yield a similar decreasing trend of −0.017 to −0.020 per decade for τc over the North Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean Sea that is attributable to reduced emissions from North
America and Europe, respectively. On the contrary, both MODIS and CAM5
display an increasing trend of +0.017 to +0.036 per decade for
τc over the tropical Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the
Arabian Sea, which reflects the influence of increased anthropogenic
emissions from South Asia and the Middle East in the last 2 decades. Over the
northwestern Pacific Ocean, which is often affected by East Asian emissions of
pollution and dust, the MODIS retrievals show a decreasing trend of −0.021 per decade for τc and −0.012 per decade for τd, which is, however, not reproduced by the CAM5 model. In other outflow
regions strongly influenced by biomass burning smoke or dust, both MODIS
retrievals and CAM5 simulations show no statistically significant trends;
the MODIS-observed interannual variability is usually larger than that
of the CAM5 simulation.},

dust plume, using a comprehensive set of satellite and ground-based observations (including MODIS, CALIOP, SEVIRI, AERONET, and EPA Air Quality
network) and the NASA GEOS global aerosol transport model. The MODIS data record registered this massive dust intrusion event as the most intense
episode over the past 2 decades. During this event, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed by AERONET and MODIS peaked at 3.5 off the coast of
West Africa and 1.8 in the Caribbean Basin. CALIOP observations show that the top of the dust plume reached altitudes of 6–8 km in West Africa
and descended to about 4 km altitude over the Caribbean Basin and 2 km over the US Gulf of Mexico coast. The dust intrusion event degraded the
air quality in Puerto Rico to a hazardous level, with maximum daily PM10 concentration of 453 µg m−3 recorded on
23 June. The dust intrusion into the US raised the PM2.5 concentration on 27 June to a level exceeding the EPA air quality standard in
about 40 \% of the stations in the southern US. Satellite observations reveal that dust emissions from convection-generated haboobs and other
sources in West Africa were large albeit not extreme on a daily basis. However, the anomalous strength and northern shift of the North Atlantic
Subtropical High (NASH) together with the Azores low formed a closed circulation pattern that allowed for accumulation of the dust near the African
coast for about 4 d. When the NASH was weakened and wandered back to the south, the dust outflow region was dominated by a strong African easterly
jet that rapidly transported the accumulated dust from the coastal region toward the Caribbean Basin, resulting in the record-breaking African dust
intrusion. In comparison to satellite observations, the GEOS model reproduced the MODIS observed tracks of the meandering dust plume well as it was
carried by the wind systems. However, the model substantially underestimated dust emissions from haboobs and did not lift up enough dust to the
middle troposphere for ensuing long-range transport. Consequently, the model largely missed the satellite-observed elevated dust plume along the
cross-ocean track and underestimated the dust intrusion into the Caribbean Basin by a factor of more than 4. Modeling improvements need to focus on
developing more realistic representations of moist convection, haboobs, and the vertical transport of dust.},

A new database is constructed comprising millions of deep convective clouds that spans the global tropics and subtropics for the entire record of the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites. The database is a collection of individual cloud objects ranging from isolated convective cells to mesoscale convective cloud systems spanning hundreds of thousands of square kilometers in cloud area. By matching clouds in the database with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis dataset and microwave imager brightness temperatures from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – EOS (AMSR-E) instrument, the database is designed to explore the relationships among the horizontal scale of cloud systems, the thermodynamic environment within which the cloud resides, the amount of aerosol in the environment, and indicators of the microphysical structure of the clouds. We find that the maximum values of convective available potential energy and vertical shear of the horizontal wind associated with a cloud impose a strong constraint on the size attained by a convective cloud system, although the relationship varies geographically. The cloud database provides a means of empirically studying the factors that determine the spatial structure and coverage of convective cloud systems, which are strongly related to the overall radiative forcing by cloud systems. The observed relationships between cloud system size and structure from this database can be compared with similar relationships derived from simulated clouds in atmospheric models to evaluate the representation of clouds and convection in weather forecast and climate projection simulations, including whether models exhibit the same relationships between the atmospheric environment and cloud system size and structure. Furthermore, the dataset is designed to probe the impacts of aerosols on the size and structure of deep convective cloud systems.},

Nonetheless, the inherent variability of solar irradiance poses a significant challenge for seamlessly integrating solar power into the electrical grid. While the majority of prior research has centered on employing purely time series-based methodologies for solar forecasting, only a limited number of studies have taken into account factors such as cloud cover or the surrounding physical context. In this paper, we put forth a deep learning architecture designed to harness spatio-temporal context using satellite data, to attain highly accurate {\textbackslash}textit\{day-ahead\} time-series forecasting for any given station, with a particular emphasis on forecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). We also suggest a methodology to extract a distribution for each time step prediction, which can serve as a very valuable measure of uncertainty attached to the forecast. When evaluating models, we propose a testing scheme in which we separate particularly difficult examples from easy ones, in order to capture the model performances in crucial situations, which in the case of this study are the days suffering from varying cloudy conditions. Furthermore, we present a new multi-modal dataset gathering satellite imagery over a large zone and time series for solar irradiance and other related physical variables from multiple geographically diverse solar stations. Our approach exhibits robust performance in solar irradiance forecasting, including zero-shot generalization tests at unobserved solar stations, and holds great promise in promoting the effective integration of solar power into the grid.},

            Low-level marine clouds play a pivotal role in Earth’s weather and climate through their interactions with radiation, heat and moisture transport, and the hydrological cycle. These interactions depend on a range of dynamical and microphysical processes that result in a broad diversity of cloud types and spatial structures, and a comprehensive understanding of cloud morphology is critical for continued improvement of our atmospheric modeling and prediction capabilities moving forward. Deep learning has recently accelerated our ability to study clouds using satellite remote sensing, and machine learning classifiers have enabled detailed studies of cloud morphology. A major limitation of deep learning approaches to this problem, however, is the large number of hand-labeled samples that are required for training. This work applies a recently developed self-supervised learning scheme to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to map marine cloud imagery to vector embeddings that capture information about mesoscale cloud morphology and can be used for satellite image classification. The model is evaluated against existing cloud classification datasets and several use cases are demonstrated, including training cloud classifiers with very few labeled samples, interrogation of the CNN’s learned internal feature representations, cross-instrument application, and resilience against sensor calibration drift and changing scene brightness. The self-supervised approach learns meaningful internal representations of cloud structures and achieves comparable classification accuracy to supervised deep learning methods without the expense of creating large hand-annotated training datasets.
            
              Significance Statement
              Marine clouds heavily influence Earth’s weather and climate, and improved understanding of marine clouds is required to improve our atmospheric modeling capabilities and physical understanding of the atmosphere. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful research tool that can be used to identify and study specific marine cloud types in the vast number of images collected by Earth-observing satellites. While powerful, these approaches require hand-labeling of training data, which is prohibitively time intensive. This study evaluates a recently developed self-supervised deep learning method that does not require human-labeled training data for processing images of clouds. We show that the trained algorithm performs competitively with algorithms trained on hand-labeled data for image classification tasks. We also discuss potential downstream uses and demonstrate some exciting features of the approach including application to multiple satellite instruments, resilience against changing image brightness, and its learned internal representations of cloud types. The self-supervised technique removes one of the major hurdles for applying deep learning to very large atmospheric datasets.},

              Clouds can be classified into regimes based on their appearance or meteorological controlling factors. The cloud appearance regimes inherently include adjustments to aerosol effects, such as transitions between closed and open cells. Therefore, calculating cloud susceptibilities to aerosols for each cloud‐appearance regime individually and then aggregating them excludes much of the cloud adjustment component of the susceptibilities. In contrast, aggregating susceptibilities over regimes defined by cloud‐controlling factors includes the full effects of cloud adjustments. Here we compared the susceptibilities of the two kinds of cloud regimes and demonstrated this effect. Overall, increasing cloud droplet number concentration (
              N
              
                d
              
              ) consistently correlates to weaker precipitation, higher cloud fraction (CF), and reduced liquid water path, regardless of how the regime is defined. However, their susceptibilities to

              aggregated over cloud‐appearance regimes are significantly lower than those aggregated over cloud‐controlling factors regimes, with lower‐tropospheric stability (LTS) serving as an example to define cloud‐controlling factors regimes. This underestimation is more pronounced for CF susceptibility, where the susceptibility for cloud appearance regimes is only 1/4 of the susceptibility for cloud controlling regimes. These findings imply that relying solely on cloud‐appearance regimes may underestimate the effective radiative forcing produced by cloud adjustment (ERF
              aci
              ). Nevertheless, the substantial variability in the magnitude of cloud adjustment across appearance regimes at similar LTS also suggests that a single cloud‐controlling factor is not sufficient to fully separate cloud regimes to quantify cloud adjustment. Therefore, identifying a comprehensive set of cloud‐controlling factors is essential for accurately quantifying cloud adjustments in future studies.

            Plain Language Summary
            
              Understanding the impact of aerosols on marine low clouds is vital for accurately predicting changes in Earth's climate. Their interactions, known as aerosol‐cloud interactions (ACI), introduce significant uncertainty into our estimates of how much human activities contribute to climate change. Clouds exhibit varying responses to changes in cloud droplet number concentration (
              N
              
                d
              
              ), a proxy for aerosols, depending on specific cloud regimes representing distinct atmospheric conditions. However, the definition of cloud regime is often vague, with some defined based on the appearance of clouds and others on their meteorological controlling factors. In our study, we compared the sensitivity of cloud properties to
              N
              
                d
              
              between these two different definitions of cloud regimes. We found that cloud susceptibilities to
              N
              
                d
              
              aggregated over cloud‐appearance regimes are notably lower than those aggregated over cloud‐controlling factors regimes. Cloud fraction susceptibility to
              N
              
                d
              
              aggregated over cloud appearance regimes is only one‐fourth of that over cloud controlling regimes. These results suggest that quantifying cloud adjustment to
              N
              
                d
              
              simply within cloud appearance regimes will likely underestimate the effective radiative forcing of ACI (ERF
              aci
              ) without accounting for the effect of aerosols on cloud‐appearance regimes.

	abstract = {Human induced changes in atmospheric aerosols have introduced a climate forcing by modifying cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water, and cloud fraction. This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud adjustments have not only complex dependence on background conditions, but also temporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar heating. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited. Here, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the cloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted clouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to automatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud adjustments to aerosols. We show that more aged polluted clouds with extended nighttime exposure exhibit higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast, liquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally decrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most of these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from differences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud fraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1 to -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal variations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may partially offset it. These findings underscore the importance of diel variations in aerosol cloud interactions. Our approach demonstrates that ship tracks, despite appearing as instantaneous observations, yield valuable insights into the temporal evolution of cloud adjustments.},

            We demonstrate the feasibility of solving atmospheric remote sensing problems with machine learning using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), implemented using convolutional neural networks. We apply the CGAN to generating two‐dimensional cloud vertical structures that would be observed by the CloudSat satellite‐based radar, using only the collocated Moderate‐Resolution Imaging Spectrometer measurements as input. The CGAN is usually able to generate reasonable guesses of the cloud structure and can infer complex structures such as multilayer clouds from the Moderate‐Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data. This network, which is formulated probabilistically, also estimates the uncertainty of its own predictions. We examine the statistics of the generated data and analyze the response of the network to each input parameter. The success of the CGAN in solving this problem suggests that generative adversarial networks are applicable to a wide range of problems in atmospheric science, a field characterized by complex spatial structures and observational uncertainties.
