	abstract = {Cloud droplet effective radius (DER) is generally negatively correlated with aerosol optical depth (AOD) as a proxy of cloud condensation nuclei. In this study, cases of positive correlation were found over certain portions of the world by analyzing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products, together with a general finding that DER may increase or decrease with aerosol loading depending on environmental conditions. The slope of the correlation between DER and AOD is driven primarily by water vapor amount, which explains 70\% of the variance in our study. Various potential artifacts that may cause the positive relation are investigated including the effects of aerosol swelling, partially cloudy, atmospheric dynamics, cloud three-dimensional (3-D) and surface influence effects. None seems to be the primary cause for the observed phenomenon, although a certain degree of influence exists for some of the factors. Analyses are conducted over seven regions around the world representing different types of aerosols and clouds. Only two regions show positive dependence of DER on AOD, near coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and South China Sea, which implies physical processes may at work. Using a 2-D Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE) with spectral-bin microphysics which incorporated a reformulation of the Kohler theory, two possible physical mechanisms are hypothesized. They are related to the effects of slightly soluble organics (SSO) particles and giant cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Model simulations show a positive correlation between DER and AOD, due to a decrease in activated aerosols with an increasing SSO content. Addition of a few giant CCNs also increases the DER. Further investigations are needed to fully understand and clarify the observed phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interaction is recognized as one of the key factors influencing cloud properties and precipitation regimes across local, regional, and global scales and remains one of the largest uncertainties in understanding and projecting future climate changes. Deep convective clouds (DCCs) play a crucial role in the general circulation, energy balance, and hydrological cycle of our climate system. The complex aerosol-DCC interactions continue to be puzzling as more "aerosol effects” unfold, and systematic assessment of such effects is lacking. Here we systematically assess the aerosol effects on isolated DCCs based on cloud-resolving model simulations with spectral bin cloud microphysics. We find a dominant role of vertical wind shear in regulating aerosol effects on isolated DCCs, i.e., vertical wind shear qualitatively determines whether aerosols suppress or enhance convective strength. Increasing aerosols always suppresses convection under strong wind shear and invigorates convection under weak wind shear until this effect saturates at an optimal aerosol loading. We also found that the decreasing rate of convective strength is greater in the humid air than that in the dry air when wind shear is strong. Our findings may resolve some of the seemingly contradictory results among past studies by considering the dominant effect of wind shear. Our results can provide the insights to better parameterize aerosol effects on convection by adding the factor of wind shear to the entrainment term, which could reduce uncertainties associated with aerosol effects on climate forcing.},

In this paper the authors use remote sensing data mainly from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product to investigate a few general cloud macro- and microphysical properties of DCCs. This investigation concentrates on the tallest convective clouds and associated thick anvils that are labeled "deep convective clouds.” General geographical patterns of DCCs from MODIS data are consistent with previous studies. By examining statistics of optical properties of DCCs over different locations of the globe, it is found that cloud optical depth distribution for DCCs shows little interannual variability for individual regions. These distributions, however, change with geographical regions. DCC ice particle size varies with surface elevation and cloud brightness temperature. DCCs that develop over elevated areas tend to have smaller ice particles at cloud top. There is a positive correlation between ice particle size and brightness temperature. The slope of this correlation has significant regional variations, which can be explained either with a simple thermodynamic consideration or with homogeneous freezing of aerosols. The findings have important implications in studying radiation budget, ice cloud microphysics parameterization, and troposphere-stratosphere water vapor exchange.},

One of the difficulties has been the lack of characterization of vertical profiles of cloud hydrometeor phase. Here we propose a technique to estimate the DCC glaciation temperature using passive remote sensing data. It is based on a conceptual model of vertical hydrometeor size profiles inside DCCs. Estimates from the technique agree well with our general understanding of the problem. Furthermore, the link between vertical profiles of cloud particle size and hydrometeor thermodynamic phase is confirmed by a 3-D cloud retrieval technique. The technique is applied to aircraft measurements of cloud side reflectance and the result was compared favorably with an independent retrieval of thermodynamic phase based on different refractive indices at 2.13 mu m and 2.25 mu m.

	abstract = {Lightning activity over the West Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines is usually much less frequent than over the nearby maritime continents. However, in 2005 the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) aboard the TRMM satellite observed anomalously high lightning activity in that area. In the same year the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) measured anomalously high aerosol loading. The high aerosol loading was traced to volcanic activity, and not to any factor linked to meteorology, disentangling the usual convolution between aerosols and meteorology. We show that in general lightning activity is tightly correlated with aerosol loadings at both inter-annual and biweekly time scales. We estimate that a similar to 60\% increase in aerosol loading leads to more than 150\% increase in lightning flashes. Aerosols increase lightning activity through modification of cloud microphysics. Cloud ice particle sizes are reduced and cloud glaciation is delayed to colder temperature when aerosol loading is increased. TRMM precipitation radar measurements indicate that anomalously high aerosol loading is associated with enhanced cloud mixed phase activity and invigorated convection over the maritime ocean. These observed associations between aerosols, cloud microphysics, morphology and lightning activity are not related to meteorological variables or ENSO events. The results have important implications for understanding the variability of lightning and resulting aerosol-chemistry interactions. Citation: Yuan, T., L. A. Remer, K. E. Pickering, and H.

Low-cloud fraction has a strong land-ocean contrast with oceanic values double those over land. Major low-cloud regimes include not only the eastern ocean boundary stratocumulus and shallow cumulus but also those associated with cold air outbreaks downwind of wintertime continents and land stratus over particular geographic areas. Globally, about 30\% of low clouds are overlapped by high clouds. The overlap rate exhibits strong spatial variability ranging from higher than 90\% in the tropics to less than 5\% in subsidence areas and is anticorrelated with subsidence rate and low-cloud fraction. The zonal mean of vertical separation between cloud layers is never smaller than 5 km and its zonal variation closely follows that of tropopause height, implying a tight connection with tropopause dynamics. Possible impacts of cloud overlap on low clouds are discussed.},

	abstract = {Modeling studies have shown that cloud feedbacks are sensitive to the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, while cloud feedbacks themselves strongly influence the magnitude of SST anomalies. Observational counterparts to such patterned interactions are still needed. Here we show that distinct large-scale patterns of SST and low-cloud cover (LCC) emerge naturally from objective analyses of observations and demonstrate their close coupling in a positive local SST-LCC feedback loop that may be important for both internal variability and climate change. The two patterns that explain the maximum amount of covariance between SST and LCC correspond to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, leading modes of multidecadal internal variability. Spatial patterns and time series of SST and LCC anomalies associated with both modes point to a strong positive local SST-LCC feedback. In many current climate models, our analyses suggest that SST-LCC feedback strength is too weak compared to observations. Modeled local SST-LCC feedback strength affects simulated internal variability so that stronger feedback produces more intense and more realistic patterns of internal variability. To the extent that the physics of the local positive SST-LCC feedback inferred from observed climate variability applies to future greenhouse warming, we anticipate significant amount of delayed warming because of SST-LCC feedback when anthropogenic SST warming eventually overwhelm the effects of internal variability that may mute anthropogenic warming over parts of the ocean. We postulate that many climate models may be underestimating both future warming and the magnitude of modeled internal variability because of their weak SST-LCC feedback.},

AI-CD uses a conditional generative adversarial net (cGAN) framework to model distribution of 2-D cloud reflectance in nature as observed by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Specifically, the AI-CD models the conditional distribution of cloud reflectance fields given a set of large-scale environmental conditions such as instantaneous sea surface temperature, estimated inversion strength, surface wind speed, relative humidity and large-scale subsidence rate together with random noise. We show that AI-CD can not only generate realistic cloudy scenes but also capture known, physical dependence of cloud properties on large-scale variables. AI-CD is stochastic in nature because generated cloud fields are influenced by random noise. Therefore, given a fixed set of large-scale variables, an ensemble of cloud reflectance fields can be generated using AI-CD. We suggest that AI-CD approach can be used as a data driven framework for stochastic cloud parameterization because it can realistically model sub-grid cloud distributions and their sensitivity to meteorological variables.},

The trained generator generates visually realistic cloud scenes. Furthermore, the model learns ten physically meaningful categories each corresponding to a particular morphology. We also show that by perturbing other latent variables while keeping the cloud category variable the same, the model can generate images that have the same morphology but with substantial variations.

It finds more ship tracks than all previous studies combined and produces a map of ship track distributions off the California coast that matches well with known shipping traffic.

The nonlinearity of cloud-state changes to aerosol perturbations make it challenging to attribute causality in observed relationships of aerosol radiative forcing. Using correlations to infer causality can be challenging when meteorological variability also drives both aerosol and cloud changes independently. Natural and anthropogenic aerosol perturbations from well-defined sources provide “opportunistic experiments” (also known as natural experiments) to investigate ACI in cases where causality may be more confidently inferred. These perturbations cover a wide range of locations and spatiotemporal scales, including point sources such as volcanic eruptions or industrial sources, plumes from biomass burning or forest fires, and tracks from individual ships or shipping corridors. We review the different experimental conditions and conduct a synthesis of the available satellite datasets and field campaigns to place these opportunistic experiments on a common footing, facilitating new insights and a clearer understanding of key uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing. Cloud albedo perturbations are strongly sensitive to background meteorological conditions. Strong liquid water path increases due to aerosol perturbations are largely ruled out by averaging across experiments. Opportunistic experiments have significantly improved process-level understanding of ACI, but it remains unclear how reliably the relationships found can be scaled to the global level, thus demonstrating a need for deeper investigation in order to improve assessments of aerosol radiative forcing and climate change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Being able to differentiate low-cloud morphology offers a tool for the research community to go one step beyond bulk cloud statistics such as cloud fraction and advance the understanding of low clouds. Here we report the progress of our project that aims to create an observational record of low-cloud mesoscale morphology at a near-global (60◦ S–60◦ N) scale. First, a training set is created by our team members manually labeling thousands of mesoscale (128 × 128) MODIS scenes into six different categories: stratus, closed cellular convection, disorganized convection, open cellular convection, clustered cumulus convection, and suppressed cumulus convection. Then we train a deep convolutional neural network model using this training set to classify individual MODIS scenes at 128 × 128 resolution and test it on a test set. The trained model achieves a cross-type average precision of about 93 \%. We apply the trained model to 16 years of data over the southeastern Paciﬁc. The resulting climatological distribution of low-cloud morphology types shows both expected and unexpected features and suggests promising potential for low-cloud studies as a data product.},

While the tropical arm of AMO is responsible for many of these impacts, it is either too weak or completely absent in many climate model simulations. Here we show, using both observational and model evidence, that the radiative effect of positive low cloud and dust feedbacks is strong enough to generate the tropical arm of AMO, with the low cloud feedback more dominant. The feedbacks can be understood in a consistent dynamical framework: weakened tropical trade wind speed in response to a warm middle latitude SST anomaly reduces dust loading and low cloud fraction over the tropical Atlantic, which warms the tropical North Atlantic SST. Together they contribute to the appearance of the tropical arm of AMO. Most current climate models miss both the critical wind speed response and two positive feedbacks though realistic simulations of them may be essential for many climatic studies related to the AMO.},

It provides a unified framework for and is consistent with relationships in the literature.

The warming effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases has been partially balanced by the cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols. In 2020, fuel regulations abruptly reduced the emission of sulfur dioxide from international shipping by about 80\% and created an inadvertent geoengineering termination shock with global impact. Here we estimate the regulation leads to a radiative forcing of \$\$+0.2{\textbackslash}pm 0.11\$\$Wm−2 averaged over the global ocean. The amount of radiative forcing could lead to a doubling (or more) of the warming rate in the 2020 s compared with the rate since 1980 with strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The warming effect is consistent with the recent observed strong warming in 2023 and expected to make the 2020 s anomalously warm. The forcing is equivalent in magnitude to 80\% of the measured increase in planetary heat uptake since 2020. The radiative forcing also has strong hemispheric contrast, which has important implications for precipitation pattern changes. Our result suggests marine cloud brightening may be a viable geoengineering method in temporarily cooling the climate that has its unique challenges due to inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity.},

We estimate that the Cf adjustment drives between 52\% and 300\% of additional forcing to the Twomey effect over the ocean and a total AIF of −1.1 ± 0.8 W m−2. The Cf adjustment follows a power law as a function of background cloud droplet number concentration, Nd . It thus depends on time and location and is stronger when Nd  is low.

            Ship‐tracks are important natural/opportunistic experiments to study aerosol‐cloud interactions (ACIs). However, detectable ship‐tracks are not produced in many instances. Virtual ship‐tracks have been conceived to expand the scale of ACIs analyses. Cloud responses in virtual ship‐tracks differ strongly from those of detected ones. Here we show that the current approach of virtual ship‐tracks can lead to systematic biases and errors and suggest necessary improvements. Errors in trajectory modeling introduce mismatches between areas actually affected by ship‐emissions and virtual ship‐track locations, that is, positional errors. Positional errors systematically underestimate ACI signals and the underestimate is severe as indicated by analysis of cloud droplet number concentration changes. The assumption of fixed ship‐track width also systematically diminishes resulting aerosol effects by more than 10\%, which leads to a forcing difference of around 0.1 . We make suggestions to improve the simulation of virtual ship‐tracks so that their full potential for studying ACIs can be unleashed.

            Plain Language Summary
            Ship‐tracks are ideal opportunistic experiments that help us understand aerosol‐cloud interactions. However, most ships do not produce detectable ship‐tracks. Virtual ship‐tracks have been conceived to expand the scale of analyses and have revealed new insights. We show here that current methods of virtual ship‐tracks has two major errors that systematically bias aerosol‐cloud interaction results. We suggest ways to reduce these errors and realize the potential of virtual ship‐tracks.

              The productivity of the Amazon rainforest is constrained by the availability of nutrients, in particular phosphorus (P). Deposition of long‐range transported African dust is recognized as a potentially important but poorly quantified source of phosphorus. This study provides a first multiyear satellite‐based estimate of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin using three‐dimensional (3‐D) aerosol measurements over 2007–2013 from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The 7 year average of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin is estimated to be 28 (8–48) Tg a

              . The dust deposition shows significant interannual variation that is negatively correlated with the prior‐year rainfall in the Sahel. The CALIOP‐based multiyear mean estimate of dust deposition matches better with estimates from in situ measurements and model simulations than a previous satellite‐based estimate does. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and inclusion of meridional dust transport calculation in addition to the 3‐D nature of CALIOP aerosol measurements. The imported dust could provide about 0.022 (0.006–0.037) Tg P of phosphorus per year, equivalent to 23 (7–39) g P ha

Aerosol loading is heaviest in mideastern China with a mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 0.5 and increasing to 0.7 around major cities that reduced daily mean surface solar radiation by ∼30–40 W m

The MODIS AOD data from Collection 5 (C5) agree much better with ground data than earlier releases, but considerable discrepancies still exist because of treatments of aerosol SSA and surface albedo. Four methods are proposed/adopted to derive the SSA by means of remote sensing and in situ observation, which varies drastically with time and space. The nationwide means of AOD, Ångström exponent, and SSA (0.5

However, detecting aerosol effect on cloud amount has been elusive to both observations and modeling due to potential buffering mechanisms and convolution of meteorology. Here through a natural experiment provided by long-term degassing of a low-lying volcano and use of A-Train satellite observations, we show modifications of trade cumulus cloud fields including decreased droplet size, decreased precipitation efficiency and increased cloud amount are associated with volcanic aerosols. In addition we find significantly higher cloud tops for polluted clouds. We demonstrate that the observed microphysical and macrophysical changes cannot be explained by synoptic meteorology or the orographic effect of the Hawaiian Islands. The "total shortwave aerosol forcin", resulting from direct and indirect forcings including both cloud albedo and cloud amount, is almost an order of magnitude higher than aerosol direct forcing alone. Furthermore, the precipitation reduction associated with enhanced aerosol leads to large changes in the energetics of air-sea exchange and trade wind boundary layer. Our results represent the first observational evidence of large-scale increase of cloud amount due to aerosols in a trade cumulus regime, which can be used to constrain the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models. The findings also have implications for volcano-climate interactions and climate mitigation research.},

Approximately half of the dust and pollution over North America comes from Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Asian dust is the largest fraction of this total. Furthermore, potential increases in dust emissions in response to climate change might overwhelm any reductions in pollution from emerging Asian economies.

            Many types of aerosols have lifetimes long enough for their transcontinental transport, making them potentially important contributors to air quality and climate change in remote locations. We estimate that the mass of aerosols arriving at North American shores from overseas is comparable with the total mass of particulates emitted domestically. Curbing domestic emissions of particulates and precursor gases, therefore, is not sufficient to mitigate aerosol impacts in North America. The imported contribution is dominated by dust leaving Asia, not by combustion-generated particles. Thus, even a reduction of industrial emissions of the emerging economies of Asia could be overwhelmed by an increase of dust emissions due to changes in meteorological conditions and potential desertification.},

We show, using different satellite data sets, that the size distribution of these pouches show a universal scaling. We argue that such scaling is an emergent property of the cloud system, which results from numbers interactions at the microscopic scale.},

            Hurricane Irene (2011) moved northward along the eastern coast of the United States and was expected to cause severe wind and flood damage. However, the hurricane weakened much faster than was predicted. Moreover, the minimum pressure in Irene occurred, atypically, about 40 h later than the time of maximum wind speed. Possible reasons for Irene’s weakening and the time shift between maximum wind and minimum central pressure were studied in simulations using WRF with spectral bin microphysics (WRF-SBM) with 1-km grid spacing and ocean coupling. Both ocean coupling and aerosol distribution/concentration were found to influence Irene’s development. Without ocean coupling or with ocean coupling and uniform aerosol distribution, the simulated maximum wind occurred at about the same time as the minimum pressure. With ocean coupling and nonuniform spatial aerosol distributions caused by aerosols from the Saharan air layer (band) and the continental United States, the maximum wind occurred about 40 h before the simulated minimum pressure, in agreement with observations. Concentrations of aerosols of several hundred per cubic centimeter in the inner core were found to initially cause convection invigoration in the simulated eyewall. In contrast, a weakening effect dominated at the mature and the decaying stages, when aerosols from the band and land intensified convection at the simulated storm’s periphery. Simulations made with 3-km instead of 1-km grid spacing suggest that cloud-scale processes interactions are required to correctly simulate the timing differences between maximum wind and minimum pressure.},

Vertical profiles of cloud particle phase in tropical deep convective clouds (DCCs) were investigated using airborne solar spectral radiation data collected by the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO) during the ACRIDICON-CHUVA campaign, which was conducted over the Brazilian rainforest in September 2014. A phase discrimination retrieval based on imaging spectroradiometer measurements of DCC side spectral reflectivity was applied to clouds formed in different aerosol conditions. From the retrieval results the height of the mixed-phase layer of the DCCs was determined. The retrieved profiles were compared with in situ measurements and satellite observations. It was found that the depth and vertical position of the mixed-phase layer can vary up to 900 m for one single cloud scene. This variability is attributed to the different stages of cloud development in a scene. Clouds of mature or decaying stage are affected by falling ice particles resulting in lower levels of fully glaciated cloud layers compared to growing clouds. Comparing polluted and moderate aerosol conditions revealed a shift of the lower boundary of the mixed-phase layer from 5.6 ± 0.2 km (269 K; moderate) to 6.2 ± 0.3 km (267 K; polluted), and of the upper boundary from 6.8 ± 0.2 km (263 K; moderate) to 7.4 ± 0.4 km (259 K; polluted), as would be expected from theory.},

            Satellite measurements provide the only global‐scale picture of cloud properties and are widely used in the research community. Since the first comparisons of satellite and aircraft measurements of characteristic cloud drop size, significant disagreement between the two has been found. Past studies assumed that disagreement is because of faults in how the satellite observations are handled as opposed to issues with the aircraft measurements. In this study we show that which aircraft instrument is chosen for comparison with satellite measurements can affect whether satellite and aircraft measurements agree and that an appropriate choice of aircraft instrument leads to robust agreement between satellite and aircraft measurements. Using a database of over 200,000 aircraft measurements in cloud, we show why some aircraft instruments are unable to accurately measure cloud properties in certain meteorological settings.

	abstract = {Abstract. Volcanic eruptions in otherwise clean environments are “natural experiments” wherein the effects of aerosol emissions on clouds and climate can be partitioned from meteorological variability and anthropogenic activities. In this work, we combined satellite retrievals, reanalysis products, and atmospheric modeling to analyze the mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions during two degassing events at the Kilauea volcano in 2008 and 2018. The eruptive nature of the 2008 and 2018 degassing events was distinct from long-term volcanic activity for Kilauea. Although previous studies assessed the modulation of cloud properties from the 2008 event, this is the first time such an analysis has been reported for the 2018 event and that multiple degassing events have been analyzed and compared at this location. Both events resulted in significant changes in cloud effective radius and cloud droplet number concentration that were decoupled from local meteorology and in line with an enhanced cloud albedo. However, it is likely that the effects of volcanic emissions on liquid water path and cloud fraction were largely offset by meteorological variability. Comparison of cloud anomalies between the two events suggested a threshold response of aerosol–cloud interactions to overcome meteorological effects, largely controlled by aerosol loading. In both events, the ingestion of aerosols within convective parcels enhanced the detrainment of condensate in the upper troposphere, resulting in deeper clouds than observed under pristine conditions. Accounting for ice nucleation on ash particles led to enhanced ice crystal concentrations at cirrus levels and a slight decrease in ice water content, improving the correlation of the model results with the satellite retrievals. Overall, aerosol loading, plume characteristics, and meteorology contributed to changes in cloud properties during the Kilauea degassing events.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Emissions and long-range transport of mineral dust and
combustion-related aerosol from burning fossil fuels and biomass vary from
year to year, driven by the evolution of the economy and changes in
meteorological conditions and environmental regulations. This study offers
both satellite and model perspectives on the interannual variability and
possible trends of combustion aerosol and dust in major continental outflow
regions over the past 15 years (2003–2017). The decade-long record of
aerosol optical depth (AOD, denoted as τ), separately for combustion
aerosol (τc) and dust (τd), over global oceans is
derived from the Collection 6 aerosol products of the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard both Terra and Aqua. These
MODIS Aqua datasets, complemented by aerosol source-tagged simulations using
the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5), are then analyzed to
understand the interannual variability and potential trends of τc
and τd in the major continental outflows. Both MODIS and CAM5
consistently yield a similar decreasing trend of −0.017 to −0.020 per decade for τc over the North Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean Sea that is attributable to reduced emissions from North
America and Europe, respectively. On the contrary, both MODIS and CAM5
display an increasing trend of +0.017 to +0.036 per decade for
τc over the tropical Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the
Arabian Sea, which reflects the influence of increased anthropogenic
emissions from South Asia and the Middle East in the last 2 decades. Over the
northwestern Pacific Ocean, which is often affected by East Asian emissions of
pollution and dust, the MODIS retrievals show a decreasing trend of −0.021 per decade for τc and −0.012 per decade for τd, which is, however, not reproduced by the CAM5 model. In other outflow
regions strongly influenced by biomass burning smoke or dust, both MODIS
retrievals and CAM5 simulations show no statistically significant trends;
the MODIS-observed interannual variability is usually larger than that
of the CAM5 simulation.},

dust plume, using a comprehensive set of satellite and ground-based observations (including MODIS, CALIOP, SEVIRI, AERONET, and EPA Air Quality
network) and the NASA GEOS global aerosol transport model. The MODIS data record registered this massive dust intrusion event as the most intense
episode over the past 2 decades. During this event, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed by AERONET and MODIS peaked at 3.5 off the coast of
West Africa and 1.8 in the Caribbean Basin. CALIOP observations show that the top of the dust plume reached altitudes of 6–8 km in West Africa
and descended to about 4 km altitude over the Caribbean Basin and 2 km over the US Gulf of Mexico coast. The dust intrusion event degraded the
air quality in Puerto Rico to a hazardous level, with maximum daily PM10 concentration of 453 µg m−3 recorded on
23 June. The dust intrusion into the US raised the PM2.5 concentration on 27 June to a level exceeding the EPA air quality standard in
about 40 \% of the stations in the southern US. Satellite observations reveal that dust emissions from convection-generated haboobs and other
sources in West Africa were large albeit not extreme on a daily basis. However, the anomalous strength and northern shift of the North Atlantic
Subtropical High (NASH) together with the Azores low formed a closed circulation pattern that allowed for accumulation of the dust near the African
coast for about 4 d. When the NASH was weakened and wandered back to the south, the dust outflow region was dominated by a strong African easterly
jet that rapidly transported the accumulated dust from the coastal region toward the Caribbean Basin, resulting in the record-breaking African dust
intrusion. In comparison to satellite observations, the GEOS model reproduced the MODIS observed tracks of the meandering dust plume well as it was
carried by the wind systems. However, the model substantially underestimated dust emissions from haboobs and did not lift up enough dust to the
middle troposphere for ensuing long-range transport. Consequently, the model largely missed the satellite-observed elevated dust plume along the
cross-ocean track and underestimated the dust intrusion into the Caribbean Basin by a factor of more than 4. Modeling improvements need to focus on
developing more realistic representations of moist convection, haboobs, and the vertical transport of dust.},

The presentation of
mesoscale cellular convection, with respect to geographic distribution,

with prior knowledge. Two tropical and subtropical cumuliform boundary layer regimes, suppressed cumulus and clustered cumulus, are studied in detail. The patterns in precipitation, circulation, column water vapor, and cloudiness are consistent with the representation of marine shallow

the suppressed and clustered low-cloud types are found to be well separated
by variables associated with low-level mesoscale circulation, with surface
wind divergence being the clearest discriminator between them, regardless of whether reanalysis or satellite observations are used. Clustered regimes are associated with surface convergence, while suppressed regimes are associated with surface divergence.},

A new database is constructed comprising millions of deep convective clouds that spans the global tropics and subtropics for the entire record of the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites. The database is a collection of individual cloud objects ranging from isolated convective cells to mesoscale convective cloud systems spanning hundreds of thousands of square kilometers in cloud area. By matching clouds in the database with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis dataset and microwave imager brightness temperatures from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – EOS (AMSR-E) instrument, the database is designed to explore the relationships among the horizontal scale of cloud systems, the thermodynamic environment within which the cloud resides, the amount of aerosol in the environment, and indicators of the microphysical structure of the clouds. We find that the maximum values of convective available potential energy and vertical shear of the horizontal wind associated with a cloud impose a strong constraint on the size attained by a convective cloud system, although the relationship varies geographically. The cloud database provides a means of empirically studying the factors that determine the spatial structure and coverage of convective cloud systems, which are strongly related to the overall radiative forcing by cloud systems. The observed relationships between cloud system size and structure from this database can be compared with similar relationships derived from simulated clouds in atmospheric models to evaluate the representation of clouds and convection in weather forecast and climate projection simulations, including whether models exhibit the same relationships between the atmospheric environment and cloud system size and structure. Furthermore, the dataset is designed to probe the impacts of aerosols on the size and structure of deep convective cloud systems.},

Nonetheless, the inherent variability of solar irradiance poses a significant challenge for seamlessly integrating solar power into the electrical grid. While the majority of prior research has centered on employing purely time series-based methodologies for solar forecasting, only a limited number of studies have taken into account factors such as cloud cover or the surrounding physical context. In this paper, we put forth a deep learning architecture designed to harness spatio-temporal context using satellite data, to attain highly accurate {\textbackslash}textit\{day-ahead\} time-series forecasting for any given station, with a particular emphasis on forecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). We also suggest a methodology to extract a distribution for each time step prediction, which can serve as a very valuable measure of uncertainty attached to the forecast. When evaluating models, we propose a testing scheme in which we separate particularly difficult examples from easy ones, in order to capture the model performances in crucial situations, which in the case of this study are the days suffering from varying cloudy conditions. Furthermore, we present a new multi-modal dataset gathering satellite imagery over a large zone and time series for solar irradiance and other related physical variables from multiple geographically diverse solar stations. Our approach exhibits robust performance in solar irradiance forecasting, including zero-shot generalization tests at unobserved solar stations, and holds great promise in promoting the effective integration of solar power into the grid.},

            Low-level marine clouds play a pivotal role in Earth’s weather and climate through their interactions with radiation, heat and moisture transport, and the hydrological cycle. These interactions depend on a range of dynamical and microphysical processes that result in a broad diversity of cloud types and spatial structures, and a comprehensive understanding of cloud morphology is critical for continued improvement of our atmospheric modeling and prediction capabilities moving forward. Deep learning has recently accelerated our ability to study clouds using satellite remote sensing, and machine learning classifiers have enabled detailed studies of cloud morphology. A major limitation of deep learning approaches to this problem, however, is the large number of hand-labeled samples that are required for training. This work applies a recently developed self-supervised learning scheme to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to map marine cloud imagery to vector embeddings that capture information about mesoscale cloud morphology and can be used for satellite image classification. The model is evaluated against existing cloud classification datasets and several use cases are demonstrated, including training cloud classifiers with very few labeled samples, interrogation of the CNN’s learned internal feature representations, cross-instrument application, and resilience against sensor calibration drift and changing scene brightness. The self-supervised approach learns meaningful internal representations of cloud structures and achieves comparable classification accuracy to supervised deep learning methods without the expense of creating large hand-annotated training datasets.
            
              Significance Statement
              Marine clouds heavily influence Earth’s weather and climate, and improved understanding of marine clouds is required to improve our atmospheric modeling capabilities and physical understanding of the atmosphere. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful research tool that can be used to identify and study specific marine cloud types in the vast number of images collected by Earth-observing satellites. While powerful, these approaches require hand-labeling of training data, which is prohibitively time intensive. This study evaluates a recently developed self-supervised deep learning method that does not require human-labeled training data for processing images of clouds. We show that the trained algorithm performs competitively with algorithms trained on hand-labeled data for image classification tasks. We also discuss potential downstream uses and demonstrate some exciting features of the approach including application to multiple satellite instruments, resilience against changing image brightness, and its learned internal representations of cloud types. The self-supervised technique removes one of the major hurdles for applying deep learning to very large atmospheric datasets.},

              Clouds can be classified into regimes based on their appearance or meteorological controlling factors. The cloud appearance regimes inherently include adjustments to aerosol effects, such as transitions between closed and open cells. Therefore, calculating cloud susceptibilities to aerosols for each cloud‐appearance regime individually and then aggregating them excludes much of the cloud adjustment component of the susceptibilities. In contrast, aggregating susceptibilities over regimes defined by cloud‐controlling factors includes the full effects of cloud adjustments. Here we compared the susceptibilities of the two kinds of cloud regimes and demonstrated this effect. Overall, increasing cloud droplet number concentration (
              N
              
                d
              
              ) consistently correlates to weaker precipitation, higher cloud fraction (CF), and reduced liquid water path, regardless of how the regime is defined. However, their susceptibilities to

              aggregated over cloud‐appearance regimes are significantly lower than those aggregated over cloud‐controlling factors regimes, with lower‐tropospheric stability (LTS) serving as an example to define cloud‐controlling factors regimes. This underestimation is more pronounced for CF susceptibility, where the susceptibility for cloud appearance regimes is only 1/4 of the susceptibility for cloud controlling regimes. These findings imply that relying solely on cloud‐appearance regimes may underestimate the effective radiative forcing produced by cloud adjustment (ERF
              aci
              ). Nevertheless, the substantial variability in the magnitude of cloud adjustment across appearance regimes at similar LTS also suggests that a single cloud‐controlling factor is not sufficient to fully separate cloud regimes to quantify cloud adjustment. Therefore, identifying a comprehensive set of cloud‐controlling factors is essential for accurately quantifying cloud adjustments in future studies.

            Plain Language Summary
            
              Understanding the impact of aerosols on marine low clouds is vital for accurately predicting changes in Earth's climate. Their interactions, known as aerosol‐cloud interactions (ACI), introduce significant uncertainty into our estimates of how much human activities contribute to climate change. Clouds exhibit varying responses to changes in cloud droplet number concentration (
              N
              
                d
              
              ), a proxy for aerosols, depending on specific cloud regimes representing distinct atmospheric conditions. However, the definition of cloud regime is often vague, with some defined based on the appearance of clouds and others on their meteorological controlling factors. In our study, we compared the sensitivity of cloud properties to
              N
              
                d
              
              between these two different definitions of cloud regimes. We found that cloud susceptibilities to
              N
              
                d
              
              aggregated over cloud‐appearance regimes are notably lower than those aggregated over cloud‐controlling factors regimes. Cloud fraction susceptibility to
              N
              
                d
              
              aggregated over cloud appearance regimes is only one‐fourth of that over cloud controlling regimes. These results suggest that quantifying cloud adjustment to
              N
              
                d
              
              simply within cloud appearance regimes will likely underestimate the effective radiative forcing of ACI (ERF
              aci
              ) without accounting for the effect of aerosols on cloud‐appearance regimes.

	abstract = {Human induced changes in atmospheric aerosols have introduced a climate forcing by modifying cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water, and cloud fraction. This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud adjustments have not only complex dependence on background conditions, but also temporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar heating. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited. Here, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the cloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted clouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to automatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud adjustments to aerosols. We show that more aged polluted clouds with extended nighttime exposure exhibit higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast, liquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally decrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most of these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from differences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud fraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1 to -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal variations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may partially offset it. These findings underscore the importance of diel variations in aerosol cloud interactions. Our approach demonstrates that ship tracks, despite appearing as instantaneous observations, yield valuable insights into the temporal evolution of cloud adjustments.},
